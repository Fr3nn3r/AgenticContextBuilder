small fixes: I want the pipeline review to be at the bottom of the left hand list
the order in the batch selectors (everywhere should be descending)
On the document review I want to be able to copy the docID under field extraction and the batchID
the document review search field overlaps with the BAtch selection
The classification review screen should not exist, it should be a panel with 2 simple buttons on the document review screen above field extraction. Follow the same pattern as the field expandable menu to stay consistent. in the expanded view show the extraction template applied and the appropriate buttons, when the classification is infermed, all the extractions field menues must turn grey since it doesn't mean as much any more.
