TBC New requirements: I want to make it obvious to the user that the screens Classification Review, document review, claims review and benchmark are based on a batch extraction, I'm thinking of making a tree under Extraction (since it is the man selection screen and also to have the batch selection drop down on the left hand side.... but I am not sure if it's is the best solution)


Here is the problem, I have 3 screens, document review, claims review, benchmark who all depend on a given batch to be selected (the extraction batch in scope), all have a drop down selector the Extraction screen actually shows all the extractions and allows the selection. Basically is should be obvious to the user whne a given screen is based on a batch extraction and which batch it is. Currenlty I'm not so happy about the solution, I'm thinking of making a tree under Extraction (since it is the man selection screen but I am not sure if it's is a good solution), I'm also thinking of having a batch selection and then leveraging tabs? I'd like you to advise me as a senior UX designer, you have access to the code you can look a the UI... what do you recommend in my situation
