The UI must be more consistent accross screen, specifically: Classification Review and Document Review use the entire width of the page unlike Benchmark and Extraction.
The runs should have a more human readable label.
The run selector should be consistent accross all 4 run dependent screens: same position on the screen (similar to calssification review but with more details)
The run selection should be remembered acrross all screens
Screens should only display the data relevant to the selected extraction run, review this page by page.
The classification review screen must allow to view the document content by default (PDF Viewer / image when available) 
The detailed document review (claims) should now be called Claims Document Review
The title of the screen should only appear once at the very top like in Classification Review, and Benchmark unlike in Extraction, Document Review
We need a NEW screen: Document Review (previous one will was claims focused and was renamed Claims Document Review), this screen must have the same structure as the Detailed Document Review screen (with the field extraction at the right) except the list on the left shows all the documents in the selected run, this screen must allow navigation (next / previous doc - from within the list) However this screen doesn't need to know the concept of claims.
