# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# IMPORTANT
- never EVER push to github unless the User explicitly tells you to.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards (from .cursorrules)
- **Simplicity First**: Clean, modular code over complexity
- **Extensive Comments**: Explain WHY, not just WHAT - especially thought process
- **Header Comments**: Every file starts with 3 comments (location, purpose, scope)
- **No Feature Creep**: Execute exactly what's requested, nothing more
- **Never Auto-Push**: Only push to GitHub when explicitly requested

### UI Design Principles
- Dark mode default with neutral grays (never blue-tinted)
- Card-based layouts with subtle borders (#333333, #2C2C2C)
- Text hierarchy: white primary, neutral-300/400/500 secondary
- Extensive tooltips for context
- Responsive mobile-first design

### Anti-Complexity Philosophy
- BE VERY SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY COMPLICATION - simple = good, complex = bad
- Do exactly what's asked, nothing more
- Execute precisely what the user asks for, without additional features
- Constantly verify you're not adding anything beyond explicit instructions

### Comment Strategy
- Add a lot of comments into the code you write
- Explain WHY the code was added, not just WHAT it does
- Focus on explaining non-obvious stuff, nuances and details
- NEVER delete explanatory comments unless they are wrong/obsolete

### Communication Style
- Use simple & easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences
- Be CLEAR and STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
- EXPLAIN EVERYTHING CLEARLY & COMPLETELY
- Address ALL of user's points and questions clearly and completely.

# IMPORTANT
- never EVER push to github unless the User explicitly tells you to.
