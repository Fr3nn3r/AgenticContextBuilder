3. **Key Data Points**: Extract the top 10 most important data points as key-value pairs

## Output Format

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object in this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "summary": "Brief description of document content and purpose",
  "content_category": "category_from_list",
  "key_data_points": [
    {{"key": "field_name", "value": "field_value", "confidence": 0.95}},
    {{"key": "field_name", "value": "field_value", "confidence": 0.90}},
    ...
  ],
  "category_confidence": 0.90,
  "language": "ISO 639-1 code (e.g., en, es, fr)"
}}
```

## Extraction Rules

- Extract actual values from the document, not placeholders or examples
- Include confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) for each extracted value
- Higher confidence means more certain about the extraction accuracy
- If a document doesn't clearly fit any category, use "other" and explain in the summary
- Focus on business-critical information such as:
  - Identifiers (claim numbers, policy numbers, invoice numbers, etc.)
  - Dates (incident dates, due dates, service dates, etc.)
  - Amounts (totals, subtotals, payments, deductibles, etc.)
  - Names (individuals, companies, providers, etc.)
  - Locations (addresses, incident locations, etc.)
  - Status indicators (approved, pending, paid, etc.)
- Format dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) when possible
- For currency amounts, include the currency code if identifiable
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or markdown formatting
