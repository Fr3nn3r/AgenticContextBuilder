## Prompt 2: Context Library Builder

**Purpose:** Create permanent and evergreen memory documents
**Method:** Conversational interview extracting core work knowledge
**Output:** Three formatted markdown documents ready to use across AI tools

---

### Question Flow:

**Introduction**

"I'm going to help you build three core documents that will serve as your permanent AI context library:
1. **Profile & Preferences** - Who you are and how you work
2. **Work Playbooks** - Your repeatable processes and standards
3. **References** - Domain knowledge and technical specs you use regularly

Let's build these one at a time."

---

### Part 1: Profile & Preferences

**Writing & Communication Style**

1. "How would you describe your writing style?"
   - Formal, technical, academic, conversational, direct, etc.

2. "What are your non-negotiable quality standards for written work?"
   *(e.g., "Always cite sources," "No jargon unless defined," "Active voice preferred")*

3. "Are there specific things you want AI outputs to avoid?"
   *(e.g., excessive formatting, generic phrases, certain tones)*

4. "What level of detail do you typically need in responses?"
   - High-level summaries
   - Detailed explanations with examples
   - Depends on context

**Work Constraints & Preferences**

5. "What are recurring constraints in your work?"
   *(e.g., word limits, deadline patterns, budget ranges, client requirements)*

6. "Are there tools, formats, or platforms you always use?"
   *(e.g., "All docs in Google Docs," "Code in Python," "Slides for executives")*

7. "What's your typical workflow or work rhythm?"
   *(e.g., morning strategy, afternoon execution; batch similar tasks; etc.)*

**Domain Context**

8. "What's your background? What expertise do you bring to your work?"
   *(Education, prior roles, specialized knowledge)*

9. "What shouldn't an AI assume you know?"
   *(Areas where you want explanations, not shortcuts)*

10. "What shouldn't an AI explain because you definitely already know it?"
    *(Your areas of deep expertise)*

---

### Part 2: Work Playbooks

**Repeatable Processes**

11. "What tasks do you do repeatedly where the process is generally the same?"
    *(e.g., "Weekly status reports," "Client onboarding," "Code reviews")*

12. "For each repeatable task, walk me through your standard process."
    *(I'll ask follow-up questions for each one you mention)*

**Quality Rubrics**

13. "How do you evaluate if your work is 'good enough to ship'?"
    *(What's your internal checklist?)*

14. "Are there specific rubrics, frameworks, or evaluation criteria you use?"
    *(e.g., "Use the STAR method for examples," "Apply the pyramid principle")*

**Definitions & Terminology**

15. "Are there terms, acronyms, or concepts specific to your work that an AI might misunderstand?"
    *(Internal terminology, industry jargon, role-specific definitions)*

16. "For each term you mentioned, what's the precise definition you use?"

**Decision Frameworks**

17. "When you're facing a common decision point in your work, what framework do you use?"
    *(e.g., "Prioritize by impact/effort matrix," "Always validate with client first")*

---

### Part 3: References

**Domain Knowledge**

18. "What bodies of knowledge do you draw on regularly in your work?"
    *(e.g., specific technical standards, industry frameworks, research areas)*

19. "For each knowledge area, what are the key concepts or principles I should know?"

**Technical Specifications**

20. "Are there technical specs, APIs, or standards you reference frequently?"
    *(e.g., "Always use Material Design 3 guidelines," "RESTful API standards")*

21. "Where can these be found? Do you want links included for verification?"

**Client/Project Templates**

22. "Do you have standard templates or structures you reuse?"
    *(e.g., proposal template, project brief format, report structure)*

23. "For each template, what are the required sections and what goes in each?"

**External Resources**

24. "What external resources do you reference most often?"
    *(Books, websites, documentation, style guides)*

25. "Should these be cited in a specific format?"

---

### Formatting & Maintenance

**Version Control**

26. "How do you want to track changes to these documents over time?"
    - Manual "Last updated" dates
    - Version numbers
    - Change log section
    - No tracking needed

**Usage Examples**

27. "For each playbook or reference, can you give me an example of when you'd use it?"
    *(This helps me write clearer documentation)*

**Portability Check**

28. "Let's verify: these documents need to work in:"
    *(List the AI tools you mentioned earlier)*
    "Are there any tool-specific formatting requirements I should know about?"

---

### Output Structure:

I'll create three markdown files:

**1. profile-and-preferences.md**
- Writing style guidelines
- Quality standards
- Work constraints
- Domain expertise map
- What to explain vs. what to assume
- Last reviewed: [date]

**2. work-playbooks.md**
- Repeatable processes (step-by-step)
- Quality rubrics
- Terminology definitions
- Decision frameworks
- Usage examples for each
- Last reviewed: [date]

**3. references.md**
- Domain knowledge summaries
- Technical specifications with links
- Templates and structures
- External resource citations
- Organized by category
- Last reviewed: [date]

Each file will include:
- Clear section headers
- Portable markdown formatting
- Examples of good vs. bad usage
- Cross-references where relevant
- Metadata for version tracking

Ready to start? Let's begin with Profile & Preferences, question 1: How would you describe your writing style?
