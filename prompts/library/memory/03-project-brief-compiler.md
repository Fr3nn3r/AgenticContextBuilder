## Prompt 3: Project Brief Compiler

**Purpose:** Transform messy project information into clean, AI-optimized briefs
**Method:** Conversational extraction and verification
**Output:** Structured project brief ready to paste into AI context windows

---

### Question Flow:

**Introduction**

"I'm going to help you create a clean project brief from whatever materials you have—messy notes, meeting transcripts, scattered documents, or just your recollection. The goal is a concise, fact-checked brief that gives an AI everything it needs to help you with this project.

We'll go through this together, and I'll help you separate confirmed facts from assumptions. Let's build these one at a time."

---

### Input Gathering

1. "What project are we creating a brief for? Give me a working title or description."

2. "What materials do you have about this project?"
   - Meeting notes or transcripts
   - Existing documents or specs
   - Email threads
   - Just my memory of conversations
   - Mix of above

3. "Go ahead and paste/share whatever you have. Don't worry about it being messy—I'll help you extract what matters."
   *(Wait for user to provide materials)*

---

### Goal & Audience Extraction

4. "In one sentence: what is this project supposed to achieve?"
   *(The core outcome)*

5. "Who is this for? Who's the primary audience or beneficiary?"

6. "What does success look like? How will you know when this is done?"

7. "Is there a specific deliverable format required?"
   *(e.g., document, presentation, code, system, design)*

---

### Canonical Facts Verification

8. "Let me list the factual claims I found in your materials. For each one, tell me if it's **confirmed** or **assumed**:"
   *(I'll list things like: IDs, dates, metrics, names, technical requirements, budget/resource constraints)*

   For each fact:
   - "Is this confirmed? Where did it come from?"
   - "If assumed, do we need to verify it before proceeding?"

9. "Are there any links, reference documents, or source materials that should be attached to this brief?"

10. "Are there specific numbers, metrics, or technical details that are non-negotiable?"
    *(The facts where being wrong would break everything)*

---

### Scope Boundaries

11. "What is explicitly **in scope** for this project?"
    *(What you're definitely doing)*

12. "What is explicitly **out of scope**?"
    *(What you're definitely NOT doing, or 'not in this phase')*

13. "Are there any edge cases or boundary scenarios we should clarify now?"
    *(The gray areas that cause confusion later)*

---

### Constraints & Prior Decisions

14. "What constraints are you working within?"
    - Timeline/deadline
    - Budget/resources
    - Technical limitations
    - Policy/compliance requirements
    - Team capacity
    - Other

15. "Have any major decisions already been made that shouldn't be revisited?"
    *(e.g., "We're using Python, that's final," "Client already approved the approach")*

16. "Are there any decisions still pending that could change the direction?"

---

### Acceptance Criteria

17. "What are the specific criteria for accepting this work as complete?"
    *(Not vague goals—concrete yes/no checkpoints)*

18. "Who needs to approve or sign off on the deliverable?"

19. "What would cause you to reject the work or send it back for revision?"

---

### Risks & Unknowns

20. "What are the biggest risks or uncertainties in this project?"

21. "What information is still missing that you need to track down?"

22. "If you had to flag one thing that could derail this project, what would it be?"

---

### Context for AI Assistance

23. "What specifically do you need AI help with on this project?"
    - Research and information gathering
    - Drafting or writing
    - Technical implementation
    - Analysis or evaluation
    - Review and feedback
    - Other

24. "Is there background context an AI would need to understand your industry, domain, or technical environment?"
    *(Things that aren't project-specific but are necessary context)*

---

### Format Optimization

25. "How long should this brief be?"
    - As short as possible (just key facts)
    - Moderate (enough detail to avoid questions)
    - Comprehensive (everything someone would need)

26. "Do you want this optimized for:"
    - Pasting into a single conversation
    - Reusing across multiple AI sessions
    - Sharing with team members
    - All of the above

---

### Output Structure:

I'll create a structured project brief in markdown containing:

**Header:**
- Project title
- Last updated date
- Status (planning/active/review)

**1. Goal & Audience**
- Primary objective (1 sentence)
- Audience/beneficiary
- Success criteria

**2. Deliverable**
- Format and specifications
- Acceptance criteria
- Approval process

**3. Scope**
- In scope (bullet list)
- Out of scope (bullet list)
- Key boundaries/edge cases

**4. Confirmed Facts**
- Canonical data (IDs, dates, metrics)
- Technical requirements
- Resource constraints
- Source links where applicable

**5. Assumptions Requiring Verification**
- Unconfirmed claims
- Pending decisions
- Information gaps

**6. Prior Decisions**
- Choices already made
- Rationale (where relevant)

**7. Constraints**
- Timeline
- Budget/resources
- Technical/policy limitations

**8. Risks & Unknowns**
- Key uncertainties
- Potential blockers

**9. Context for AI**
- What you need help with
- Domain/technical background
- Relevant reference materials

**Token count estimate:** ~[X] tokens

**Verification checklist:** 
- [ ] All dates confirmed
- [ ] All IDs/metrics verified
- [ ] Scope boundaries clear
- [ ] Acceptance criteria specific
- [ ] Assumptions flagged
