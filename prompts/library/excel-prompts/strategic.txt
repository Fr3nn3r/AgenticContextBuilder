Step 1 - Build Comprehensive Assumptions Sheet:
Create an "Assumptions" sheet that serves as the single source of truth for all model inputs:

SECTION 1: REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS

Growth & Customer Metrics:
- Starting customer count (as of [date])
- Monthly/quarterly new customer additions (Year 1, Year 2, Year 3)
- Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) by year
- Customer churn rate (monthly %) by customer segment
- Price increases (timing and %)

Revenue by Stream (if multiple):
- Product Revenue assumptions
- Service Revenue assumptions
- Other Revenue assumptions
- Mix % by year

Customer Segmentation (if applicable):
- Enterprise: % of customers, ARPC, churn rate, growth rate
- Mid-Market: % of customers, ARPC, churn rate, growth rate
- SMB: % of customers, ARPC, churn rate, growth rate

Seasonal Patterns:
- Monthly revenue distribution (if seasonal)
- Q1: X%, Q2: Y%, Q3: Z%, Q4: W%

SECTION 2: COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)

For each revenue stream, define:
- COGS as % of revenue OR fixed cost per unit
- Key drivers: hosting costs, payment processing fees, direct labor
- Scaling assumptions: Does COGS % improve with scale?

Example for SaaS:
- Cloud hosting: $X per customer per month, decreases 10% per year with scale
- Payment processing: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Customer support: $X per customer per month for first 1,000 customers, then economies of scale

SECTION 3: HEADCOUNT PLAN

Create detailed hiring plan by department and year:

Engineering:
- Starting headcount: X
- Year 1 hires: +Y (specify quarters: Q1: +2, Q2: +3, etc.)
- Year 2 hires: +Z
- Year 3 hires: +W
- Average salary: $X (with annual increases %)
- Fully-loaded multiplier: 1.35x (includes benefits, taxes, equipment)

Repeat for each department:
- Product Management
- Sales (split by: Enterprise AEs, Mid-Market AEs, SDRs, Sales Leadership)
- Marketing (split by: Marketing Leadership, Content, Demand Gen, Product Marketing)
- Customer Success
- Operations
- Finance & Admin
- Executive

For each role category, specify:
- Base salary
- Variable compensation (commission, bonus) as % of base
- Ramp time (months until fully productive)
- Quota/target (for sales roles)

SECTION 4: OPERATING EXPENSES (NON-HEADCOUNT)

Sales & Marketing:
- Digital advertising: $X/month in Year 1, growing Y% annually
- Events & conferences: $X annually
- Marketing tools & software: $X/month
- Sales tools (CRM, sales engagement): $X/month
- Partner/channel costs: X% of revenue
- Sales commissions: X% of revenue or specific structure

Technology & Infrastructure:
- Engineering tools & licenses: $X/month
- Cloud infrastructure: modeled in COGS or here if fixed
- Security & compliance tools: $X/month
- Data & analytics platforms: $X/month

Facilities & Operations:
- Office rent: $X per employee per month (or total if fixed lease)
- Utilities & internet: $X/month
- Office supplies & equipment: $X per employee per year
- Insurance: $X annually

Professional Services:
- Legal: $X annually (increases with funding rounds)
- Accounting & tax: $X annually
- Consultants: $X as needed (specify)
- Recruiting fees: X% of hired employee salaries OR $X per hire

General & Administrative:
- Software & subscriptions (non-engineering): $X/month
- Travel: $X per employee per year
- Training & development: $X per employee per year
- Other G&A: $X/month

SECTION 5: CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Hardware & Equipment:
- Laptops/computers: $X per employee (at hire)
- Servers/equipment: $X in Year Y
- Furniture: $X per employee
- Office buildout: $X one-time cost

SECTION 6: WORKING CAPITAL ASSUMPTIONS

Cash Conversion:
- Accounts Receivable: Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) = X days
  (Time from invoice to cash collection)
- Accounts Payable: Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) = Y days
  (Time from receiving bill to paying it)
- Inventory: Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) = Z days (if applicable)

Collection Assumptions:
- % of revenue collected in same month: X%
- % collected 30 days later: Y%
- % collected 60 days later: Z%
- % uncollectible (bad debt): W%

SECTION 7: FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS

Existing Cash:
- Current cash balance: $X
- Current debt: $X (terms: interest rate, maturity)

Planned Funding:
- Series A: $Xm in Quarter Y of Year 1
- Series B: $Ym in Quarter Z of Year 2
- Debt facility: $Zm available in Year 2 (interest rate X%, terms)

SECTION 8: KEY BUSINESS METRICS

Calculate or track:
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $X (from historical data or target)
- CAC Payback Period: X months (target)
- Lifetime Value (LTV): $X (from cohort analysis)
- LTV:CAC ratio target: X:1
- Gross margin target: X%
- Rule of 40 target: Revenue Growth % + EBITDA Margin % > 40%
- Burn multiple target: Net Burn / Net New ARR < 1.5x

FORMATTING:
- Use clear section headers with colored backgrounds
- Group related assumptions together
- Use data validation (dropdowns) where appropriate
- Color code: Blue for inputs, White/Gray for calculations
- Add notes/comments explaining any complex assumptions
- Include sources for assumptions (e.g., "Based on 2024 actuals" or "Industry benchmark")
- Lock/protect assumption cells that shouldn't change frequently

SCENARIO TOGGLES:
Add dropdown to switch between scenarios:
- Base Case (realistic)
- Upside Case (optimistic)
- Downside Case (conservative)

Key assumption changes by scenario:
- Base: Customer growth = X%, churn = Y%
- Upside: Customer growth = X+20%, churn = Y-25%
- Downside: Customer growth = X-30%, churn = Y+25%

All downstream calculations should reference these assumptions, so changing the scenario automatically updates the entire model.

​
Step 2 - Revenue Model with Multiple Streams:
Create a "Revenue Model" sheet with detailed monthly/quarterly projections:

STRUCTURE:
- Columns: Each month for 36 months (or each quarter if less granular)
- Rows: Revenue buildups and calculations

CUSTOMER COHORT APPROACH:

For each cohort (month/quarter customers were acquired):

Row structure:
- Starting Customers (Month 0)
- + New Customers Added (from Assumptions)
- - Churned Customers (Starting × Churn Rate from Assumptions)
- = Ending Customers

- Beginning MRR/ARR for cohort
- + Expansion revenue (from existing customers increasing spend)
- - Contraction revenue (from existing customers decreasing spend)
- - Churn revenue (from customers who left)
- = Ending MRR/ARR for cohort

Stack cohorts vertically so you see:

       Jan-25  Feb-25  Mar-25  Apr-25  ...
       Jan-25 Cohort:

- Customers 50 48 46 45
- MRR $50K $49K $48K $47K

Feb-25 Cohort:

- Customers -- 55 53 51
- MRR -- $58K $57K $56K

Mar-25 Cohort:

- Customers -- -- 60 58
- MRR -- -- $63K $62K

TOTALS:

- Total Customers 50 103 159 154
- Total MRR $50K $107K $168K $165K


This bottom-up approach is more accurate than simple % growth.

REVENUE CALCULATIONS:

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):
- Sum of all cohort MRRs for the month
- MRR Growth Rate: (Current MRR - Prior MRR) / Prior MRR

Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):
- MRR × 12
- Show ARR trend over 36 months

Total Revenue (for P&L):
- MRR/ARR (subscription revenue)
- + One-time revenue (implementation, setup fees)
- + Professional services revenue (if applicable)
- + Other revenue
- = Total Revenue

Revenue by Segment:
Break out by customer segment if applicable:
- Enterprise Revenue (from enterprise customer count × enterprise ARPC)
- Mid-Market Revenue
- SMB Revenue

Revenue by Product:
If multiple products:
- Product A Revenue
- Product B Revenue
- Product C Revenue

KEY METRICS TRACKING:

For each month/quarter, calculate:
- New Customer Count
- Churned Customer Count
- Net Customer Change
- Total Active Customers (ending)
- ARPC (Average Revenue Per Customer) = Total MRR / Total Customers
- Customer Churn Rate (logo churn %)
- Revenue Churn Rate (MRR churn %)
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR) = (Beginning MRR - Churn + Expansion - Contraction) / Beginning MRR
- New MRR (from new customers)
- Expansion MRR (from existing customers)
- Contraction MRR
- Churned MRR
- Net New MRR = New + Expansion - Contraction - Churn

REVENUE BRIDGE (Monthly):
Show waterfall each month:
- Starting MRR
- + New Customer MRR
- + Expansion MRR
- - Contraction MRR
- - Churned MRR
- = Ending MRR

ANNUAL SUMMARY VIEW:
Create a summary table showing Year 1, Year 2, Year 3:
- Total Revenue
- Revenue Growth Rate (%)
- Ending Customer Count
- Customer Growth Rate (%)
- Ending ARR
- Average ARPC
- NRR %
- Gross Revenue Retention %

VISUALIZATION:
Create charts showing:
- Monthly/Quarterly Revenue (bar chart)
- ARR growth (line chart)
- Customer count growth (line chart)
- Revenue bridge waterfall (monthly or quarterly)
- Revenue mix by product/segment (stacked area chart)

VALIDATION CHECKS:
- Does total revenue tie to P&L sheet?
- Are growth rates consistent with assumptions?
- Does customer count trend match hiring and CAC assumptions?
- Do revenue metrics (NRR, churn) align with assumption inputs?

Add checkboxes showing: ✓ All validations pass


​
Step 3 - Expense Model by Department:
Create an "Expense Model" sheet with detailed cost projections:

STRUCTURE:
- Columns: Each month for 36 months (match revenue model)
- Rows: Expenses by category and department

SECTION 1: COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)

For each revenue stream:
- Calculate COGS based on revenue and COGS % from Assumptions
- Or calculate based on customer count × cost per customer
- Include: hosting, payment processing, direct support costs, etc.

Total COGS by month
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Revenue

Track gross margin % monthly and ensure it trends toward target (typically improving with scale).

SECTION 2: OPERATING EXPENSES BY DEPARTMENT

For EACH department (Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing, CS, G&A, Exec):

PERSONNEL COSTS:
Build detailed headcount and cost model:

Rows for each department:
- Beginning Headcount (from prior month)
- + New Hires (from Assumptions hiring plan)
- - Departures (assume X% annual attrition OR link to specific assumptions)
- = Ending Headcount

- Base Salary Cost (Headcount × Average Salary from Assumptions, prorated for new hires)
- + Variable Compensation (commissions, bonuses)
- + Payroll Taxes & Benefits (Base × Fully-Loaded Multiplier from Assumptions, typically 1.25-1.35x)
- = Total Personnel Cost

IMPORTANT: New hires should be prorated based on start date:
- If hired mid-month, only charge 0.5 month of salary
- Sales reps have ramp period (3-6 months) where quota is reduced

NON-PERSONNEL COSTS (by department):
Link to Assumptions for:
- Software & tools specific to that department
- Contractor/freelancer costs
- Travel & entertainment
- Department-specific programs/initiatives

SECTION 3: COMPANY-WIDE OPERATING EXPENSES

Sales & Marketing (non-headcount):
- Advertising spend (from Assumptions)
- Events & conferences
- Marketing programs & campaigns
- Sales commissions (calculated as % of revenue or based on quota attainment)
- Lead generation costs
- Partner/affiliate fees

Technology & Infrastructure:
- Cloud/hosting (if not in COGS)
- Software licenses (company-wide: Slack, Zoom, GSuite, etc.)

- Banking & financial services
- Subscriptions & memberships
- Training & development
- Other G&A expenses

SECTION 4: DEPRECIATION & AMORTIZATION

If capitalizing equipment or software:
- Depreciate over useful life (typically 3-5 years for equipment)
- Amortize capitalized software development (if applicable)
- Monthly D&A expense calculated

EXPENSE SUMMARY BY CATEGORY:

Create summary sections showing:

By Nature of Expense:
- Personnel (all departments combined)
- Sales & Marketing (non-personnel)
- Technology
- Facilities
- Professional Services
- Other Operating Expenses
- Total Operating Expenses
- Total Expenses (COGS + OpEx)

By Department:
- Engineering Total Cost
- Product Total Cost
- Sales Total Cost
- Marketing Total Cost
- Customer Success Total Cost
- G&A Total Cost
- Executive Total Cost

KEY METRICS:

Calculate expense efficiency metrics monthly:
- Operating Expense as % of Revenue
- Sales & Marketing as % of Revenue
- R&D (Engineering + Product) as % of Revenue
- G&A as % of Revenue
- Cost per Employee (Total OpEx / Total Headcount)
- Revenue per Employee (Total Revenue / Total Headcount)

BURN RATE TRACKING:

Show monthly burn:
- Total Revenue
- - Total Expenses (COGS + OpEx)
- = Net Income (Loss)
- = Monthly Burn Rate (if negative)

Calculate:
- Cumulative Burn (sum of monthly burn)
- Average Monthly Burn (useful for runway calculation)
- Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR (should be <1.5x for healthy SaaS)

EXPENSE GROWTH ANALYSIS:

Track how expenses scale:
- Expense Growth Rate % (month-over-month)
- Revenue Growth Rate % (month-over-month)
- Ratio: Expense Growth vs. Revenue Growth
  * Goal: Revenue grows faster than expenses = improving unit economics

ANNUAL SUMMARY VIEW:

Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 totals:
- Total COGS and Gross Margin %
- Total Operating Expenses
- Operating Expenses by category
- Headcount by department
- Key ratios (OpEx/Revenue, etc.)

SCENARIO IMPACTS:

If using scenario toggle from Assumptions:
- Upside: Assumes better revenue, may justify more hiring/spending
- Downside: May trigger hiring freezes, expense cuts
- Show clearly which expenses are variable vs. fixed

VALIDATION:

Check that:
- Headcount additions match Assumptions sheet
- Salaries aligned with Assumptions
- Software costs growing reasonably with headcount
- Total expenses tie to P&L sheet
- Burn rate is sustainable given cash runway

​
Step 4 - Headcount Model with Fully-Loaded Costs:
Create a "Headcount Model" sheet tracking hiring plan in detail:

MASTER HEADCOUNT TABLE:

Columns:
- Employee ID / Name (can be "Engineering #1", "Sales #2" for forecasts)
- Department
- Role / Title
- Employment Start Date (Month-Year)
- Employment End Date (blank for current plan, or planned departure)
- Employment Status (Active, Future Hire, Departed)
- Location (if relevant for cost differences)
- Base Salary (annual)
- Variable Compensation Target (annual: commission, bonus)
- Total Cash Compensation
- Benefits & Taxes Cost (% of base, typically 25-35%)
- Equipment & Onboarding (one-time cost)
- Total Fully-Loaded Cost (annual)
- Monthly Cost (Fully-Loaded / 12, prorated for partial years)

HIRING SCHEDULE:

For each month across 36 months, show:
- New Hires (count) by department
- Departures (count) by department (from attrition assumptions)
- Net Headcount Change
- Ending Headcount by department
- Total Company Headcount

Example:
       Jan-25  Feb-25  Mar-25  Apr-25  ...
       Engineering:
New Hires    2       1       0       2
Departures   0       0       1       0
Net Change   +2      +1      -1      +2
Ending HC    12      13      12      14

Sales:
New Hires    1       2       1       1
...

Total Company:
New Hires    5       6       3       7
Ending HC    45      51      52      59


DEPARTMENTAL DETAIL:

For each department, create detailed breakdown:

ENGINEERING TEAM:
- Engineering Leadership (VPs, Directors): count and cost
- Senior Engineers: count and cost
- Mid-Level Engineers: count and cost

→ Total Sales Headcount & Cost

Repeat detailed breakdown for all departments.

COST CALCULATIONS:

For each employee/role:

Monthly Cost Calculation:
- If hired mid-year: Prorate costs
- Example: Hired in March, only 10 months of Year 1 salary
- Formula: (Annual Salary / 12) × (Months Active in Period)

Variable Compensation Modeling:
For sales roles with commission:
- Ramp Period: First 3-6 months, reduced quota, lower commissions
  * Month 1-3: 0% of quota → $0 commission
  * Month 4-6: 50% of quota → 50% of target commission
  * Month 7+: 100% of quota → 100% of target commission
- Link commission to revenue attainment
- Account for quota overachievement (accelerators)

Benefits & Payroll Tax Calculation:
- Federal payroll taxes: 7.65% (FICA)
- State payroll taxes: varies, assume X%
- Health insurance: $X per employee per month
- 401(k) match: Y% of salary
- Other benefits: $Z per employee per month
- Total: typically 25-35% of base salary

One-Time Costs:
- Laptop/equipment: $X (at hire)
- Onboarding & training: $Y
- Recruiting fee: Z% of salary (if using recruiters)
- Office setup: $W per employee

PRODUCTIVITY ASSUMPTIONS:

For revenue-generating roles (sales, CS):
- Ramp time to full productivity
- Quota per rep (for sales)
- Customer capacity (for CS)
- Supported ARR per CSM

Show how revenue projections align with sales capacity:
- Total Sales Headcount × Quota per Rep × Attainment % = Projected Sales
- Validate this matches Revenue Model

HEADCOUNT METRICS & RATIOS:

Calculate and track monthly:
- Total Headcount (FTE)
- Headcount by Department (count and %)
- Headcount Growth Rate (%)
- Revenue per Employee (Total Revenue / Total HC)
- OpEx per Employee (Total OpEx / Total HC)
- Engineering as % of Headcount
- Sales & Marketing as % of Headcount
- Ratio: Sales HC to Engineering HC (typical SaaS: 1:1 to 1:2)
- Ratio: Customers per CSM (typical: 50-200 depending on segment)

ANNUAL SUMMARY:

Year 1, Year 2, Year 3:
- Ending Headcount (total and by department)
- Total Personnel Costs
- Average Salary by Department
- New Hires (total)
- Departures (total)
- Net Headcount Growth

COMPENSATION BENCHMARKING:

Compare salaries to market:
- Average Engineering Salary: $X (compare to Levels.fyi, Glassdoor benchmarks)
- Average Sales Salary: $Y
- Flag roles where comp is >20% above or below market

SCENARIO PLANNING:

Toggle between hiring scenarios:
- Aggressive Growth: Hire 50% more than Base Case
- Moderate Growth: Base Case hiring plan
- Conservative: Reduce hires by 30%, extend time-to-hire

Show impact on:
- Total headcount
- Burn rate
- Revenue capacity (especially sales headcount → revenue correlation)

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SHEETS:

Ensure headcount model feeds:
- Expense Model: Personnel costs by month and department
- Cash Flow: Timing of salary payments, hiring costs
- P&L: Total personnel expenses
- Revenue Model: Sales capacity validates revenue projections

VISUALIZATION:

Create charts:
- Headcount growth over 36 months (line chart, by department stacked area)
- Department mix (pie chart showing HC distribution)
- Cost per employee over time (shows if improving or degrading)
- Revenue per employee over time (should improve as company scales)

VALIDATION CHECKS:

Ensure:
- Total headcount costs match Expense Model
- Hiring plan aligns with Assumptions sheet
- Sales capacity supports revenue projections
- Customer Success capacity supports customer count
- No unrealistic hiring (e.g., 20 hires in one month for a 50-person company)


​
Step 5 - P&L Rollup:
Create a "P&L" (Profit & Loss Statement) sheet consolidating all financial data:

STRUCTURE:
- Columns: Each month for 36 months
- Rows: Standard P&L line items

STANDARD P&L FORMAT:

REVENUE:
- Product Revenue (from Revenue Model)

→ Total Revenue

COST OF REVENUE (COGS):
- Product COGS (from Expense Model)
- Service COGS (from Expense Model)
- Other Direct Costs (from Expense Model)
→ Total COGS

GROSS PROFIT:
= Total Revenue - Total COGS
Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Total Revenue

OPERATING EXPENSES:

Sales & Marketing:
- S&M Personnel (from Headcount/Expense Model)
- Advertising & Marketing Programs

→ Total CS (some companies include in S&M or G&A)

Total Operating Expenses = S&M + R&D + G&A + CS

OPERATING INCOME (EBITDA):
= Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses

EBITDA Margin % = EBITDA / Total Revenue

Depreciation & Amortization:
- (from Expense Model if you're capitalizing assets)

OPERATING INCOME (EBIT):
= EBITDA - D&A

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSES:
- Interest Income (on cash balances)
- Interest Expense (on debt)
- Other Income/Expenses
→ Total Other Income/(Expense)

NET INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAX:
= EBIT + Other Income

Income Tax:
- (typically $0 for startups with losses, or apply expected tax rate once profitable)

NET INCOME (LOSS):
= Net Income Before Tax - Income Tax

KEY METRICS SECTION:

Below the P&L, calculate important metrics monthly:
- Revenue Growth Rate (MoM %)
- Gross Margin %
- Operating Margin %
- EBITDA Margin %
- Net Margin %
- Rule of 40: Revenue Growth % + EBITDA Margin % (should be >40% for healthy SaaS)

ANNUAL SUMMARY VIEW:

Create summary table for Year 1, Year 2, Year 3:
                      Year 1      Year 2      Year 3
                      Revenue                   $5.0M       $12.0M      $25.0M

Net Income                ($3.5M)     ($2.7M)     $0.0M

Rule of 40                --          117         108


QUARTERLY VIEW:

In addition to monthly, create quarterly rollup:
- Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 for each of the 3 years
- Easier for presentations and board review

EXPENSE RATIOS:

Show operating expenses as % of revenue:


                 Year 1    Year 2    Year 3
                 S&M % of Revenue     70%       50%       40%

Total OpEx % Rev     150%      104%      82%



Track these ratios to show improving efficiency as company scales.

BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS:

Calculate and display:
- Month when company reaches profitability (EBITDA > $0)
- Revenue required to break even
- Gross profit required to cover fixed OpEx

Show visually on chart: When does revenue line cross expense line?

COMPARISON TO BUDGET/PLAN:

If you have a separate budget or prior plan:
- Show Actual vs. Plan variance ($ and %)
- Use conditional formatting (green for favorable, red for unfavorable)

VISUALIZATION:

Create charts showing:
- Revenue and EBITDA trend (dual-axis line chart)
- Gross Margin % trend (line chart)
- Operating Expenses by category (stacked bar chart)
- Path to profitability (showing cumulative losses narrowing)

FORMATTING:

- Standard accounting format:
  * Positive numbers (revenue, assets) without parentheses
  * Negative numbers (expenses, losses) in parentheses: ($1,000)
- Currency formatting with $ and commas
- % formatting for all margin/ratio metrics
- Subtotal rows in bold with border lines
- Clear section headers (Revenue, COGS, OpEx, etc.)
- Color coding: Revenue (green), Expenses (red), Profit (blue)

VALIDATION:

Ensure:
- Revenue ties exactly to Revenue Model
- COGS ties to Expense Model
- OpEx ties to Expense Model and Headcount Model
- All calculations are formula-driven (no hard-coded numbers)
- Subtotals and totals are accurate
- Quarters and annual totals sum correctly from monthly data

INTEGRATION NOTE:

This P&L should be the "single source of truth" for income statement data.
- Cash Flow Statement will reference P&L for Net Income
- Balance Sheet will reference P&L for accumulated deficit
- Dashboard/Executive Summary will pull from P&L for key metrics

​
Step 6 - Cash Flow Statement:
Create a "Cash Flow" sheet showing cash movements:

STRUCTURE:
- Columns: Each month for 36 months
- Rows: Standard cash flow statement format

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS:

Start with Net Income:
- Net Income (Loss) from P&L

Add back non-cash expenses:
- + Depreciation & Amortization (from P&L)
- + Stock-Based Compensation (if applicable)
- + Other non-cash charges

Adjust for changes in working capital:
- - Increase in Accounts Receivable (cash not yet collected)
- + Decrease in Accounts Receivable (cash collected from prior period)
- + Increase in Accounts Payable (expenses not yet paid)
- - Decrease in Accounts Payable (paying off prior period expenses)
- - Increase in Inventory (if applicable)
- + Decrease in Inventory
- + Increase in Deferred Revenue (cash received before recognized as revenue)
- - Decrease in Deferred Revenue

= Cash Flow from Operations

WORKING CAPITAL CALCULATIONS:

Accounts Receivable:
- Based on DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) from Assumptions
- Formula: (Revenue × DSO) / 30
- Change in AR = Current Month AR - Prior Month AR
- If AR increases, it's a use of cash (customers haven't paid yet)

Accounts Payable:
- Based on DPO (Days Payable Outstanding) from Assumptions
- Formula: (COGS + OpEx) × DPO / 30
- Change in AP = Current Month AP - Prior Month AP
- If AP increases, it's a source of cash (delaying payments)

Deferred Revenue:
- For subscription businesses: Cash collected upfront but not yet earned
- Annual contracts: Collect 12 months upfront, recognize ratably
- Change in Deferred Revenue = impact on cash

CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING:

Capital Expenditures:
- Equipment purchases (from Assumptions/Headcount Model)
- Leasehold improvements
- Capitalized software development (if applicable)
- Other investments
= Cash Flow from Investing (usually negative)

CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING:

Equity Financing:
- Proceeds from funding rounds (from Assumptions: Series A, B, etc.)
- - Transaction costs (legal, banking fees: typically 2-5% of raise)
= Net Proceeds from Equity

Debt Financing:
- Proceeds from loans or credit facilities
- - Debt principal repayments
- - Interest payments (from P&L)
= Net Cash from Debt

Other Financing:
- Owner contributions
- Dividends paid (unlikely for startups)

= Cash Flow from Financing

NET CHANGE IN CASH:
= Cash from Operations + Cash from Investing + Cash from Financing

CASH RECONCILIATION:

- Beginning Cash Balance
- + Net Change in Cash
= Ending Cash Balance

Verify Ending Cash = Next Month's Beginning Cash

CUMULATIVE METRICS:

Track cumulative cash flow:
- Cumulative Cash Burn (sum of negative operating cash flow months)
- Total Equity Raised to Date
- Total Debt Drawn to Date

CASH RUNWAY:

Calculate runway monthly:
- Ending Cash Balance / Average Monthly Burn Rate = Months of Runway Remaining

Show graphically: Runway declining over time, jumping up with funding events.

BURN RATE ANALYSIS:

Calculate:
- Gross Burn: Total monthly cash out (OpEx + COGS)
- Net Burn: Gross Burn - Revenue
- Average Net Burn (trailing 3 months)
- Burn Multiple: Net Burn / Net New ARR

FUNDING MILESTONES:

Clearly mark funding events:
- Series A in Month X: +$Xm, Runway increases from Y months to Z months
- Annotate with post-funding runway

ANNUAL SUMMARY:

Year 1, Year 2, Year 3:

                          Year 1      Year 2      Year 3
                          Cash from Operations          ($5.0M)     ($3.5M)     $0.5M
Cash from Investing           ($0.5M)     ($0.3M)     ($0.4M)
Cash from Financing           $10.0M      $15.0M      $0.0M
Net Change in Cash            $4.5M       $11.2M      $0.1M

Beginning Cash                $1.0M       $5.5M       $16.7M
Ending Cash                   $5.5M       $16.7M      $16.8M


QUARTERLY CASH FLOW:

In addition to monthly, show quarterly view:
- Operating, Investing, Financing cash flows by quarter
- Easier for board/investor review

FREE CASH FLOW:

Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF):
= Cash from Operations - Capital Expenditures

This shows cash generated after necessary investments.
Becoming FCF positive is a key milestone.

SCENARIO IMPACTS:

If using scenario toggle:
- Upside: Faster revenue → better cash collection → less burn
- Downside: Slower revenue → more burn → may need more funding sooner

Show clearly when additional funding would be required in each scenario.

VISUALIZATION:

Create charts:
- Monthly ending cash balance (line chart)
- Cash runway over time (line chart showing months remaining)
- Cumulative cash burn vs. cash raised (area chart)
- Operating cash flow trend (bar chart: negative to positive over time)
- Waterfall showing cash flow components (Operations, Investing, Financing)

ALERTS & TRIGGERS:

Set thresholds for:
- When cash drops below $X (e.g., $2M): Yellow alert
- When runway drops below 12 months: Start fundraising
- When runway drops below 6 months: Red alert, urgent need for capital

INTEGRATION:

Cash Flow Statement should link to:
- P&L for Net Income and D&A
- Balance Sheet for Beginning/Ending Cash
- Working capital accounts (AR, AP, Deferred Revenue)
- Assumptions for funding rounds and timing

VALIDATION:

Check that:
- Beginning cash each month = Prior month ending cash
- Annual summaries tie to monthly data
- Cash balance never goes negative (unless you model credit line usage)
- Funding assumptions match Assumptions sheet
- Working capital calculations are reasonable (DSO, DPO align with business model)

Magic Number            0.85          0.5-0.75      0.75-1.0       >1.0


Color code: Green (at or above best-in-class), Yellow (acceptable), Red (below standard)

SECTION 8: COHORT PERFORMANCE

If you built cohort tracking:
- Cohort Retention Curves
- Cohort LTV by Vintage
- Recent Cohorts vs. Historical Performance

VISUALIZATION:

Create executive dashboard with charts:
- Revenue growth (bar chart)
- Customer growth (line chart)
- LTV:CAC trend (line chart)
- Rule of 40 components (stacked bar: growth % + margin %)
- Cash runway (line chart with funding events marked)
- NRR trend (line chart)
- Gross Margin trend (line chart)

TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM:

For each key metric, show status:
- 🟢 Green: Metric meets or exceeds target
- 🟡 Yellow: Metric is acceptable but needs watching
- 🔴 Red: Metric is below threshold, requires immediate attention

Example:
- LTV:CAC = 4.2:1 🟢 (target >3:1)
- CAC Payback = 15 months 🟡 (target <12 months)
- Gross Margin = 65% 🔴 (target >75%)

MONTHLY SCORECARD:

Create a one-page summary showing:
- Top 10 metrics
- Current month value
- Prior month value
- Change ($ and %)
- Target value
- Status (🟢🟡🔴)

Format for easy sharing with board/investors.

TREND ANALYSIS:

For key metrics, show 12-month trend:
- Highlight improving trends (↗)
- Highlight declining trends (↘)
- Flat trends (→)

ALERTS & COMMENTARY:

Auto-generate insights based on data:
- "NRR declined to 105% from 110% last quarter - investigate churn drivers"
- "CAC increased 20% while LTV flat - review S&M efficiency"
- "Rule of 40 improved to 125 from 110 - strong momentum"
- "Cash runway now 18 months - sufficient buffer before next fundraise"

SCENARIO COMPARISON:

If using scenario toggle, show key metrics side-by-side:

Metric           Base Case   Upside     Downside
Year 3 ARR       $25M        $35M       $18M
Year 3 EBITDA    $0.0M       $2.5M      ($1.5M)
Runway (months)  18          24         12
LTV:CAC Year 3   4.2:1       5.0:1      3.5:1


This helps evaluate strategy trade-offs.

INTEGRATION:

Dashboard should pull from:
- P&L for revenue and expense metrics
- Revenue Model for growth and retention metrics
- Cash Flow for cash and runway metrics
- Expense Model for efficiency metrics
- Headcount Model for per-employee metrics

All metrics should be formula-driven and update automatically when underlying data changes.

​
Step 8 - Scenario Toggles:
Create scenario functionality allowing easy comparison of different assumptions:

SCENARIO SELECTOR:

At the top of the Assumptions sheet, add a prominent dropdown:
- Dropdown cell: "Select Scenario"
- Options: Base Case | Upside Case | Downside Case | Custom

When user selects a scenario, ALL assumption values update automatically.

SCENARIO ASSUMPTION TABLES:

Create a hidden or separate area with assumption values for each scenario:

REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS BY SCENARIO:
Assumption                        Base      Upside    Downside
Monthly Customer Growth (Y1)      10%       15%       5%
Monthly Customer Growth (Y2)      8%        12%       3%
Monthly Customer Growth (Y3)      6%        10%       2%
Average ARPC                      $3,000    $3,500    $2,500
Monthly Churn Rate                3%        2%        4%
NRR Target                        108%      115%      100%


EXPENSE ASSUMPTIONS BY SCENARIO:
Assumption                        Base      Upside    Downside
Year 1 Hiring Plan                +25       +35       +15
Year 2 Hiring Plan                +30       +45       +20
Year 3 Hiring Plan                +35       +50       +25
S&M Spend (% of Revenue)          50%       55%       45%
CAC                               $4,400    $5,000    $3,800
Gross Margin Target               82%       85%       78%


FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS BY SCENARIO:
Assumption                        Base      Upside    Downside
Series A Amount                   $10M      $12M      $8M
Series A Timing                   Q4 Y1     Q3 Y1     Q1 Y2
Series B Amount                   $20M      $30M      $15M
Series B Timing                   Q4 Y2     Q3 Y2     Q2 Y3
Need Series C?                    No        No        Yes


IMPLEMENTATION:

Use Excel formulas to populate assumption cells based on scenario selection:

=IF($ScenarioCell="Upside", UpsiadeValue, IF($ScenarioCell="Downside", DownsideValue, BaseValue))

Or use a more elegant SWITCH or CHOOSE formula:
=SWITCH($ScenarioCell, "Base", BaseValue, "Upside", UpsideValue, "Downside", DownsideValue, BaseValue)


This way, every assumption cell references the scenario selector and automatically updates.

SCENARIO COMPARISON SHEET:

Create a dedicated "Scenario Comparison" sheet showing key outputs side-by-side:

FINANCIAL OUTCOMES:
Metric                    Base Case   Upside      Downside    Delta (Up vs Base)
Year 1 Revenue            $5.0M       $6.5M       $3.5M       +$1.5M (+30%)
Year 2 Revenue            $12.0M      $17.0M      $8.5M       +$5.0M (+42%)
Year 3 Revenue            $25.0M      $38.0M      $16.0M      +$13.0M (+52%)

Year 2 EBITDA             ($2.7M)     ($3.5M)     ($1.5M)     ($0.8M) more loss
Year 3 EBITDA             $0.0M       $3.0M       ($1.5M)     +$3.0M (profitable!)

Year 3 Ending Cash        $5.5M       $9.0M       $2.0M       +$3.5M
Cash Runway (months)      18          24          10          +6 months


KEY METRICS BY SCENARIO:

Base Case     $10M (Y1)   $20M (Y2)   --          $30M            65% founders
Upside        $12M (Y1)   $30M (Y2)   --          $42M            62% founders
Downside      $8M (Y2)    $15M (Y3)   $10M (Y3)   $33M            58% founders


BREAK-EVEN TIMING:
Scenario      Monthly Profitability   Annual Profitability   FCF Positive
Base Case     Month 32 (Q4 Y3)        Year 3                 Year 4
Upside        Month 28 (Q1 Y3)        Year 3                 Year 3
Downside      Month 40+ (Y4+)         Year 4                 Year 5+


VISUALIZATION:

Create comparison charts:
- Revenue by scenario (3 lines on one chart)
- EBITDA by scenario
- Cash balance by scenario (shows when Upside has excess, Downside is tight)
- Headcount by scenario

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:

Beyond the 3 scenarios, create sensitivity tables showing how key outputs change with specific variable changes:

REVENUE SENSITIVITY:
Year 3 ARR based on Customer Growth Rate and Churn:

            Churn: 2%    Churn: 3%    Churn: 4%    Churn: 5%
Growth: 15%     $42M         $38M         $34M         $30M
Growth: 10%     $32M         $28M         $25M         $22M
Growth: 5%      $22M         $19M         $17M         $15M
Growth: 0%      $14M         $12M         $10M         $9M


PROFITABILITY SENSITIVITY:
Year 3 EBITDA based on Revenue and OpEx Efficiency:
            OpEx 70% of Rev   OpEx 80% of Rev   OpEx 90% of Rev
            Revenue $40M    $5M               $1M               ($2M)
Revenue $30M    $3M               ($0.5M)           ($4M)
Revenue $20M    $1M               ($2M)             ($6M)
Revenue $15M    ($0.5M)           ($3M)             ($7.5M)


PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED FORECAST:

Assign probabilities to each scenario:
- Base Case: 60% probability
- Upside: 20% probability
- Downside: 20% probability

Calculate expected value (probability-weighted average):
Metric                    Expected Value (Probability-Weighted)
Year 3 Revenue            $23.3M
Year 3 EBITDA             ($0.5M)
Year 3 Cash               $5.1M
Total Funding Needed      $30.6M


This provides a more nuanced forecast than a single-point estimate.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY:

For each scenario, provide strategic context:

Base Case:
"Assumes steady execution on current plan. Balanced growth and spending. Reaches break-even by Year 3 end with one additional funding round."

Upside Case:
"Assumes product-market fit acceleration, efficient scaling. Aggressive but achievable hiring plan. Reaches profitability mid-Year 3, generating cash for reinvestment."

Downside Case:
"Assumes market headwinds, competitive pressure. Conservative hiring, focus on efficiency. May require third funding round in Year 3 to maintain runway."

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

Based on scenario analysis, create decision tree:
- If early indicators (Q1-Q2 performance) match Upside → Accelerate hiring
- If tracking to Base → Continue current plan
- If trending Downside → Implement cost controls, extend runway

Define specific trigger metrics and corresponding actions.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Add a "How to Use" section:
1. Select scenario from dropdown at top of Assumptions sheet
2. All sheets automatically update (P&L, Cash Flow, Dashboard, etc.)
3. Review Scenario Comparison sheet for side-by-side analysis
4. Use sensitivity tables to test specific variables
5. Update probabilities if needed for weighted forecast

CUSTOM SCENARIO:

Allow users to create "Custom" scenario:
- Select "Custom" from dropdown
- Manually adjust individual assumptions
- See outputs update in real-time
- Useful for testing specific "what-if" questions

Example custom scenarios:
- What if we delay Series B by 6 months?
- What if we cut S&M spend by 30%?
- What if ARPC increases but churn increases too?
- What if we hire 50% more engineers?

SCENARIO LOCK:

Once you've reviewed scenarios and chosen a plan, "lock" the selected scenario:
- Document which scenario becomes the official plan/budget
- Save a version as "FY2025 Board-Approved Plan"
- Use for performance tracking (Actual vs. Plan)

This prevents accidental changes and creates clear accountability.


​
Expected Outcome: A comprehensive 3-year financial model with detailed assumptions, monthly projections for revenue and expenses, headcount planning, full financial statements (P&L, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet), key metrics dashboard, and scenario analysis—suitable for strategic planning, board approval, and fundraising presentations. The model should be flexible enough to test different strategies while maintaining data integrity and formula consistency throughout.
2. SaaS Financial Model (Investor-Ready)
Context: You need a specialized financial model for a SaaS business with all the metrics and details investors expect—MRR buildup, bookings vs. revenue, cohort analysis, and SaaS-specific KPIs.
Prompt Chain:
Step 1 - MRR Buildup and Bookings Model:
Create a "MRR & Bookings" sheet modeling subscription revenue mechanics:

SECTION 1: MONTHLY RECURRING REVENUE (MRR) WATERFALL

For each month across 36 months, build MRR from the bottom up:

BEGINNING MRR:
- Starting MRR (from prior month ending MRR)

MRR ADDITIONS:
+ New MRR: Revenue from newly acquired customers
  - Calculate as: New Customers × Average Starting MRR per Customer
  - Track by customer segment (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)
  - Track by acquisition channel (Direct Sales, Inside Sales, Self-Serve)

+ Expansion MRR: Additional revenue from existing customers
  - Upsells (upgrading to higher tier)
  - Cross-sells (adding products/modules)
  - Seat/user expansion
  - Usage-based expansion
  - Price increases
  - Calculate as: Count of Expanding Customers × Average Expansion Amount

MRR REDUCTIONS:
- Contraction MRR: Revenue lost from existing customers decreasing spend
  - Downgrades (moving to lower tier)
  - Seat/user reductions
  - Usage decreases
  - Price discounts/concessions
  - Calculate as: Count of Contracting Customers × Average Contraction Amount

- Churn MRR: Revenue lost from customers who cancelled completely
  - Calculate as: Beginning MRR × Churn Rate % (by segment)
  - OR: Count of Churned Customers × Average MRR per Churned Customer

ENDING MRR:
= Beginning MRR + New MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churn MRR

NET NEW MRR:
= New MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churn MRR
This is the key growth metric investors watch.

MRR GROWTH RATE:
= (Ending MRR - Beginning MRR) / Beginning MRR
Show as monthly % and QoQ %

EXAMPLE MONTHLY WATERFALL:

Month: January 2025
Beginning MRR:           $500,000

Additions:

- New MRR: $50,000 (50 new customers @ $1,000 avg)
- Expansion MRR: $15,000 (30 customers expanded, avg $500)

Reductions:

- Contraction MRR: ($5,000) (10 customers contracted, avg $500)
- Churn MRR: ($15,000) (15 customers churned, avg $1,000)

Net New MRR:             $45,000
Ending MRR:              $545,000
MRR Growth Rate:         9.0%


SECTION 2: ARR (ANNUAL RECURRING REVENUE)

Calculate ARR from MRR:
- ARR = Ending MRR × 12
- ARR Growth Rate (QoQ, YoY)

Show ARR Bridge (quarterly):
- Beginning ARR
- + New ARR (new customers)
- + Expansion ARR (existing customer growth)
- - Contraction ARR
- - Churned ARR
- = Ending ARR
- Net New ARR

SECTION 3: BOOKINGS vs. REVENUE

Critical for understanding sales performance vs. recognized revenue:

BOOKINGS (TCV - Total Contract Value):
- New Bookings: Total contract value signed this month
  * Annual contracts: Full year value
  * Multi-year contracts: Total contract value
- Expansion Bookings: Additional contract value from existing customers
- Total Bookings

Bookings by Type:
- New Business Bookings
- Renewal Bookings (existing customers renewing)
- Expansion Bookings (upsells, cross-sells)
- Total Bookings

Bookings by Sales Team:
- Enterprise Team Bookings
- Mid-Market Team Bookings
- Inside Sales Bookings
- Self-Serve Bookings

REVENUE RECOGNITION:

Recognized Revenue depends on contract terms:
- Monthly contracts: Recognize ratably each month
- Annual contracts paid upfront: Recognize 1/12 per month over 12 months
- Multi-year contracts: Recognize ratably over contract life

Create a DEFERRED REVENUE SCHEDULE:

Month         Bookings    Revenue Recognized    Deferred Revenue Balance
Jan 2025      $120,000    $60,000              $60,000
Feb 2025      $150,000    $70,000              $140,000
Mar 2025      $130,000    $75,000              $195,000


Track:
- Deferred Revenue Balance (liability on balance sheet)
- Revenue Recognized (hits P&L)
- Deferred Revenue Rollforward:
  * Beginning Deferred Revenue
  * + New Bookings (cash collected upfront)
  * - Revenue Recognized (from deferred balance)
  * = Ending Deferred Revenue

BOOKINGS METRICS:

Calculate and track:
- Bookings Growth Rate (MoM, QoQ, YoY)
- New Bookings as % of Total
- Renewal Rate % = Renewed ARR / ARR Up for Renewal
- Expansion Rate % = Expansion Bookings / Renewals
- Bookings to Revenue Ratio (should normalize to ~1.0x over time)

SALES CAPACITY MODEL:

Link bookings to sales headcount:
- Sales Reps (by team: Enterprise, Mid-Market, Inside)
- Quota per Rep (annual booking target)
- Ramp Time (months to full productivity: typically 3-6 months)
- Attainment % (actual bookings / quota, typically 70-100%)

Calculate Expected Bookings:
= Fully Ramped Reps × Quota × Attainment %

Validate this matches your Bookings assumptions.

Example:

Sales Team        Reps    Quota/Rep    Attainment    Expected Annual Bookings
Enterprise AE     10      $1.2M        85%           $10.2M
Mid-Market AE     15      $600K        90%           $8.1M
Inside Sales      20      $300K        95%           $5.7M

---

Total             45                                 $24.0M


SECTION 4: CUSTOMER COUNTS

Track customer counts underlying MRR:

By Month:
- Beginning Customers
- + New Customers (by segment, by channel)
- - Churned Customers (by segment)
- = Ending Customers

By Segment Distribution:
- Enterprise Customers: count and % of total
- Mid-Market Customers: count and % of total
- SMB Customers: count and % of total

SECTION 5: AVERAGE REVENUE PER ACCOUNT (ARPA)

Calculate ARPA monthly:
- ARPA = Total MRR / Total Customer Count
- ARPA by Segment (Enterprise ARPA, Mid-Market ARPA, SMB ARPA)
- ARPA Growth Rate (shows if customers expanding or customer mix shifting)

Example:
Month       Total MRR    Customers    ARPA      ARPA Growth
Jan 2025    $500K        500          $1,000    --
Feb 2025    $545K        535          $1,019    +1.9%
Mar 2025    $595K        570          $1,044    +2.5%


SECTION 6: QUICK RATIO

Investors love this metric:
Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Contraction MRR + Churn MRR)

Interpretation:
- >4x: Exceptional growth, very healthy
- 2-4x: Good growth and retention
- 1-2x: Growth offsetting churn, but concerning
- <1x: MRR declining, critical issue

Track monthly and show trend.

VISUALIZATION:

Create charts showing:
- MRR waterfall (beginning → new → expansion → contraction → churn → ending)
- ARR growth over 36 months (line chart)
- Net New MRR by month (bar chart with components stacked)
- Quick Ratio trend (line chart)
- Bookings vs. Revenue (dual-axis chart)
- Customer count by segment (stacked area chart)

​
Step 2 - Retention and Cohort Analysis:
Create a "Cohort & Retention" sheet with detailed retention tracking:

SECTION 1: COHORT RETENTION TABLE

Build a comprehensive cohort table:

ROWS: Customer cohorts (by month/quarter acquired)
COLUMNS: Months since acquisition (Month 0, 1, 2, 3...24+)
VALUES: Multiple views in separate tables:

TABLE 1 - Revenue Retention:
Show MRR retained from each cohort over time

Cohort       Month 0   Month 1   Month 2   Month 3   Month 6   Month 12
Jan 2023     $100K     $98K      $97K      $99K      $105K     $115K
Feb 2023     $120K     $118K     $121K     $125K     $132K     $145K
Mar 2023     $105K     $103K     $101K     $100K     $102K     $108K


TABLE 2 - Revenue Retention %:
Show as % of Month 0 (normalized):

Cohort       Month 0   Month 1   Month 2   Month 3   Month 6   Month 12
Jan 2023     100%      98%       97%       99%       105%      115%
Feb 2023     100%      98%       101%      104%      110%      121%
Mar 2023     100%      98%       96%       95%       97%       103%


TABLE 3 - Customer Count Retention:
Show customer count from each cohort:
Cohort       Month 0   Month 1   Month 2   Month 3   Month 6   Month 12
Jan 2023     100       98        95        93        89        85
Feb 2023     120       118       116       115       112       108
Mar 2023     105       103       100       98        94        90


TABLE 4 - Customer Retention %:
Cohort       Month 0   Month 1   Month 2   Month 3   Month 6   Month 12
Jan 2023     100%      98%       95%       93%       89%       85%
Feb 2023     100%      98%       97%       96%       93%       90%
Mar 2023     100%      98%       95%       93%       90%       86%


CONDITIONAL FORMATTING:
Apply color gradient:
- Dark green: >110% (strong expansion)
- Light green: 100-110% (good retention with expansion)
- Yellow: 85-100% (acceptable retention)
- Orange: 70-85% (concerning churn)
- Red: <70% (critical churn)

SECTION 2: RETENTION METRICS

Calculate key retention metrics for each cohort and overall:

GROSS REVENUE RETENTION (GRR):
= (Beginning MRR - Churn MRR - Contraction MRR) / Beginning MRR
- Measures revenue retained excluding expansion
- Target for good SaaS: >85% monthly, >90% preferred

NET REVENUE RETENTION (NRR):
= (Beginning MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churn MRR) / Beginning MRR
- Measures revenue retained including expansion
- Target for great SaaS: >110% monthly, >120% best-in-class

LOGO RETENTION:
= (Beginning Customers - Churned Customers) / Beginning Customers
- Customer count retention
- Target: >90% monthly, >95% preferred

Calculate for:
- Each individual cohort (to spot cohort-specific issues)
- Overall company (blended across all cohorts)
- By customer segment (Enterprise vs. SMB retention patterns)
- By acquisition channel (do certain channels have better retention?)

RETENTION BY TIME PERIOD:
Show retention metrics over different time horizons:

Time Period      GRR      NRR      Logo Retention
Month 1          96%      98%      98%
Month 3          94%      101%     95%
Month 6          92%      105%     92%
Month 12         87%      112%     88%
Month 24         82%      125%     80%


This shows how retention evolves over customer lifetime.

SECTION 3: CHURN ANALYSIS

CHURN RATE CALCULATIONS:

Customer Churn Rate (Logo Churn):
= Churned Customers / Beginning Customers
- Monthly churn %
- Annualized churn % = 1 - (1 - Monthly Churn %)^12

Revenue Churn Rate:
= Churned MRR / Beginning MRR
- Monthly revenue churn %
- Annualized revenue churn %

Track churn by:
- Customer segment (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)
- Cohort vintage (are newer cohorts churning faster?)
- Contract value (do high-value customers churn less?)
- Acquisition channel
- Geography
- Product/plan type

CHURN REASONS:

Categorize why customers churn:
Churn Reason              Count    Churned MRR    % of Churn
Business Closed           15       $15,000        20%
Switched to Competitor    20       $25,000        33%
Price/Budget              10       $12,000        16%
Product Fit Issues        12       $15,000        20%
Poor Experience           5        $5,000         7%
Other                     3        $3,000         4%

---

Total                     65       $75,000        100%


PREVENTABLE vs. UNPREVENTABLE CHURN:
- Unpreventable: Business closed, acquired, budget cuts beyond control
- Preventable: Product issues, poor support, competitive losses, lack of value

Calculate % that is preventable - this is where to focus.

CHURN LEADING INDICATORS:

Identify signals that predict churn:
- Usage declining (DAU/MAU dropping)
- Support ticket volume increasing
- Product engagement score decreasing
- Payment issues (late payments, failed charges)
- Key feature adoption low
- Time since last value realization event

Create a CHURN RISK SCORE for each customer:
- High risk: Multiple warning signs, action needed
- Medium risk: Some concerning signals, monitor closely
- Low risk: Healthy engagement, likely to renew

SECTION 4: EXPANSION ANALYSIS

EXPANSION METRICS:

Expansion Rate:
= Expansion MRR / Beginning MRR (for customers who expanded)

Expansion Velocity:
= % of customer base that expands each month

Average Expansion Amount:
= Total Expansion MRR / Count of Expanding Customers

Time to First Expansion:
- Average months from acquisition to first expansion
- Shows optimal timing for upsell outreach

EXPANSION TYPES:

Break down expansion by type:
Expansion Type         Count    MRR Impact    Avg per Customer
Seat/User Additions    50       $25,000      $500
Tier Upgrades          20       $15,000      $750
Cross-sell Product     15       $10,000      $667
Usage/Volume Growth    30       $20,000      $667
Price Increase         100      $5,000       $50

---

Total Expansion        215      $75,000      $349


EXPANSION DRIVERS:

Identify what drives expansion:
- Product usage patterns (heavy users expand more)
- Customer success engagement (customers with CSM expand more)
- Feature adoption (customers using advanced features expand)
- Business outcomes (customers achieving ROI expand)
- Company growth (customer company growing = more seats/usage)

EXPANSION PLAYBOOK:

Based on analysis, create expansion strategy:
- When to approach for expansion: Month X after acquisition
- Who to target: Customers with Y engagement score
- What to pitch: Most commonly successful expansion path
- How to message: Based on customer outcomes achieved

SECTION 5: COHORT PROFITABILITY

For each cohort, calculate:

ACQUISITION COST:
- CAC for that cohort (S&M spend / new customers in that period)

GROSS PROFIT:
- Cumulative revenue from cohort
- - Cumulative COGS for serving cohort
- = Cumulative Gross Profit

PAYBACK:
- Month when cumulative gross profit exceeds CAC
- Payback period in months

LIFETIME VALUE (LTV):
- For mature cohorts (12+ months), calculate actual LTV
- Compare actual LTV to predicted LTV
- Identify which cohorts exceeded/underperformed expectations

COHORT ROI:
= (Lifetime Value - CAC) / CAC
Shows return on investment for acquiring that cohort

EXAMPLE:
Cohort      CAC      12-Mo Rev   12-Mo GP   Payback   Projected LTV   Cohort ROI
Jan 2023    $5,000   $14,400     $11,880    6 mo      $45,000        800%
Feb 2023    $4,500   $15,600     $12,870    5 mo      $50,000        1,011%
Mar 2023    $4,800   $13,200     $10,890    7 mo      $42,000        775%


BEST/WORST PERFORMING COHORTS:

Identify:
- Top 3 cohorts (by NRR, LTV, ROI)
- Bottom 3 cohorts
- What differentiated them?
  * Acquisition channel
  * Market conditions at time
  * Product version/features available
  * Initial customer segment mix
  * Onboarding process at that time

Use learnings to optimize future cohorts.

SECTION 6: FORWARD-LOOKING COHORT PROJECTIONS

Using historical cohort performance, project future cohorts:

For each future month, estimate:
- New customers acquired (from sales forecast)
- Apply average retention curve from mature cohorts
- Apply average expansion pattern
- Project revenue contribution over 24 months

SUM across all future cohorts to get total projected revenue.

This creates a bottom-up revenue forecast based on cohort behavior.

VISUALIZATION:

Charts to create:
- Cohort retention heatmap (see patterns at a glance)
- Retention curves (multiple cohort lines)
- GRR vs. NRR trend (line chart showing both)
- Churn rate trend by segment (line chart)
- Expansion rate over time
- Cohort LTV distribution (histogram)
- Revenue contribution by cohort vintage (stacked area)


​
Step 3 - SaaS Metrics Dashboard:
Create a "SaaS Metrics" sheet with investor-grade KPIs:

SECTION 1: GROWTH METRICS

Revenue Metrics:
- MRR: $X (monthly recurring revenue)
- ARR: $Y (annual recurring revenue = MRR × 12)
- MRR Growth Rate:
  * MoM %
  * QoQ %
  * YoY %
- ARR Growth Rate: X% (annualized)
- Net New MRR: $Z (monthly change)
- Net New ARR: $W (quarterly change)

Customer Metrics:
- Total Customers: X
- New Customers: Y (this month)
- Churned Customers: Z
- Net Customer Adds: Y - Z
- Customer Growth Rate: X% (MoM)

SECTION 2: EFFICIENCY & UNIT ECONOMICS

The "Magic Number":
= Net New ARR (this quarter) / Sales & Marketing Spend (last quarter)
- Measures sales & marketing efficiency
- >1.0 = Excellent (gaining $1+ ARR per $1 spent)
- 0.75-1.0 = Good
- 0.5-0.75 = Acceptable
- <0.5 = Concerning (spending too much relative to growth)

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):
= Total S&M Spend / New Customers Acquired
- By segment (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)
- By channel (Direct, Inside Sales, Self-Serve)
- Trend over time (improving or degrading?)

CAC Payback Period:
= CAC / (Monthly ARPA × Gross Margin %)
- Time to recover acquisition cost
- Target: <12 months
- Best-in-class: <6 months

LTV (Lifetime Value):
= ARPA × Gross Margin % / Revenue Churn Rate
OR = ARPA × Average Customer Lifetime × Gross Margin %
- By segment
- Trend over time

LTV:CAC Ratio:
= LTV / CAC
- Target: >3:1
- Best-in-class: >5:1
- If <3:1, unit economics may not support growth

LTV Payback Multiple:
= LTV / CAC Payback Months
- Shows how many months of payback you get for each month of payback period
- Higher is better

Sales Efficiency:
= New ARR / Fully Ramped Sales Headcount
= Sales Productivity per Rep
- Track by rep type (Enterprise vs. Inside Sales)
- Compare to benchmarks ($500K-$1M+ per rep)

SECTION 3: RETENTION & EXPANSION

Gross Revenue Retention (GRR):
= (Starting MRR - Churn MRR - Contraction MRR) / Starting MRR
- Monthly %
- Target: >90% monthly
- Annualized: (Monthly GRR)^12

Net Revenue Retention (NRR):
= (Starting MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churn MRR) / Starting MRR
- Monthly %
- Target: >100% (net expansion)
- Best-in-class: >110% monthly (>120% annually)
- Annualized: (Monthly NRR)^12

Logo Retention:
= (Starting Customers - Churned Customers) / Starting Customers
- Monthly customer retention %
- Target: >95% monthly

Customer Churn Rate:
= Churned Customers / Starting Customers
- Monthly % (inverse of Logo Retention)
- Annualized: 1 - (1 - Monthly Churn)^12

Revenue Churn Rate:
= (Churn MRR + Contraction MRR) / Starting MRR
- Monthly revenue churn %
- Annualized: 1 - (1 - Monthly Rate)^12

Expansion Rate:
= Expansion MRR / Starting MRR
- Shows organic growth from existing customers
- Target: High enough to offset churn (achieve NRR >100%)

Quick Ratio:
= (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churn MRR + Contraction MRR)
- Measures growth efficiency
- Target: >4x

SECTION 4: PROFITABILITY & MARGINS

Gross Margin:
= (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
- Target for SaaS: >70%
- Best-in-class: >80%
- Should improve with scale

Contribution Margin:
= (Revenue - COGS - Variable S&M) / Revenue
- After variable costs
- Target: >60%

EBITDA Margin:
= EBITDA / Revenue
- Early stage: Negative (investing in growth)
- Growth stage: -10% to +10%
- Mature: +20%+

Operating Margin:
= Operating Income / Revenue

Rule of 40:
= Revenue Growth Rate % + EBITDA Margin %

Format for board presentations and investor updates.

​
Step 4 - Cap Table and Funding Rounds:
Create a "Cap Table & Dilution" sheet modeling ownership and fundraising:

SECTION 1: CURRENT CAP TABLE

Build a complete capitalization table:

COLUMNS:
- Shareholder Name/Type
- Share Class (Common, Preferred Series A, B, C, etc.)
- Shares Owned
- Ownership %
- $ Invested
- Share Price
- Current Value (shares × current price)

SHAREHOLDERS:
Founders:
- Founder 1: X shares, Y% ownership
- Founder 2: X shares, Y% ownership

Employees:
- Employee Option Pool: X shares reserved, Y% of fully diluted
- Shares Issued to Employees: Z shares
- Available for Issuance: Remaining pool

Investors:
- Angel Investors: X shares (Preferred A or Common)
- Series A Investors: Y shares (Preferred Series A)
- Series B Investors: Z shares (Preferred Series B)
- [Add all investor groups]

CALCULATIONS:

Fully Diluted Shares:
= Common Shares + Preferred Shares + Unexercised Options + Reserved Option Pool

Ownership %:
= Shareholder Shares / Fully Diluted Shares

Current Value:
= Shares × Current Share Price (from last round valuation)

SECTION 2: FUNDING ROUND MODELING

For each planned funding round, model the impact:

SERIES A MODELING:

Inputs:
- Pre-Money Valuation: $X
- Investment Amount: $Y
- Investor Ownership Target: Z% (alternative to investment amount)

Calculations:
- Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money + Investment
- New Shares Issued = (Investment / Post-Money Valuation) × Total Shares Post-Investment
- Investor Ownership % = Investment / Post-Money Valuation
- Dilution to Existing Shareholders = Investor Ownership %

Example:
Series A:
Pre-Money Valuation:        $40,000,000
Investment Amount:           $10,000,000
Post-Money Valuation:        $50,000,000
Investor Ownership:          20.0%

Existing Shareholders:
Diluted by:                  20.0%
New Ownership:               80.0% of post-money


POST-SERIES A CAP TABLE:
Show updated ownership after Series A:
Shareholder          Pre-Series A    Dilution    Post-Series A
Founder 1            35.0%           -7.0%       28.0%
Founder 2            25.0%           -5.0%       20.0%
Employee Pool        15.0%           -3.0%       12.0%
Angel Investors      10.0%           -2.0%       8.0%
Series A Investors   --              +20.0%      20.0%

---

Total                100.0%          0.0%        100.0%


OPTION POOL REFRESH:

Often investors require increasing the option pool BEFORE their investment (comes out of founder dilution):

Example:
Current Option Pool:         10% (pre-money)
Investor Requires:           15% (post-money)
Pool Increase Needed:        Calculate to achieve 15% post-money
Result:                      Founders diluted MORE to create larger pool before Series A priced


Formula: New Pool % = (Desired Post-Money Pool % × Post-Money Shares) - Existing Pool Shares

SECTION 3: MULTI-ROUND PROJECTION

Model Series A, B, C, etc. with dilution waterfall:
Round        Pre-Money   Investment   Post-Money   New Investor %   Founder Ownership
Seed         $5M         $2M          $7M          28.6%           71.4%
Series A     $18M        $10M         $28M         35.7%           45.9%
Series B     $60M        $25M         $85M         29.4%           32.4%
Series C     $150M       $50M         $200M        25.0%           24.3%

Total Raised: $87M
Final Founder Ownership: 24.3%


Show how founder ownership decreases with each round.

SECTION 4: VALUATION SCENARIOS

Model different valuation scenarios for next round:
Scenario         Pre-Money    Investment    Post-Money   Dilution    Founder %
Bear Case        $30M         $15M          $45M         33.3%       22.2%
Base Case        $50M         $15M          $65M         23.1%       25.6%
Bull Case        $80M         $15M          $95M         15.8%       28.0%



Shows importance of valuation negotiations on dilution.

OPTION POOL SCENARIOS:

Model different option pool sizes:
Option Pool Size    Founder Dilution    Available for Hires
10%                 Low                 ~25-30 employees
15%                 Medium              ~40-50 employees

20%                 High                ~60-70 employees


Balance between preserving founder equity vs. having enough equity to attract talent.

SECTION 5: LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES

Model investor preferences that affect payout order:

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE TYPES:

1x Non-Participating:
- Investor gets back 1× their investment OR their ownership % of proceeds, whichever is greater

1x Participating:
- Investor gets back 1× their investment AND their ownership % of remaining proceeds

2x Participating:
- Investor gets back 2× their investment AND their ownership % of remaining proceeds

WATERFALL ANALYSIS:

Model exit scenarios to show who gets what:

Exit at $50M:
Investor Type               Investment    Preference    Payout      Return
Series A (1x participating) $10M          $10M base     $18M        1.8x
Founders & Employees        --            --            $32M        --


Exit at $100M:

Investor Type               Investment    Preference    Payout      Return
Series A (1x participating) $10M          $10M base     $28M        2.8x
Founders & Employees        --            --            $72M        --


Exit at $200M:
Investor Type               Investment    Preference    Payout      Return
Series A (1x participating) $10M          $10M base     $48M        4.8x
Founders & Employees        --            --            $152M       --


Show at what exit value the liquidation preference no longer matters (when conversion to common is better).

SECTION 6: FOUNDER VESTING

Model founder vesting and impact on equity:

Standard Vesting:
- 4-year vesting
- 1-year cliff
- Monthly vesting thereafter

Show unvested vs. vested equity over time:
Month    Unvested    Vested    % Vested
0        100%        0%        0%
12       75%         25%       25%
24       50%         50%       50%
36       25%         75%       75%
48       0%          100%      100%


Impact if founder leaves early:
- Before cliff: 0% vested, loses all equity
- At 2 years: 50% vested, forfeits 50%
- After 4 years: 100% vested, keeps everything

SECTION 7: EMPLOYEE EQUITY

Model employee option grants and value:

Typical Grants by Role:
Role                Options (# shares)   % of Company   4-Year Value @ Exit
Executive (C-level) 50,000-200,000      0.5-2.0%       $500K-$2M+
Director            20,000-50,000       0.2-0.5%       $200K-$500K
Senior IC           10,000-30,000       0.1-0.3%       $100K-$300K
Mid-level           5,000-15,000        0.05-0.15%     $50K-$150K
Junior              1,000-5,000         0.01-0.05%     $10K-$50K


(Assumes $100M exit)

OPTION VALUE CALCULATOR:

For any option grant:
- Number of options: X
- Strike price (409A): $Y
- Current valuation: $Z
- Ownership %: X / Fully Diluted Shares
- Current value: (Current valuation × Ownership %) - Exercise Cost
- Potential value at $100M exit: ($100M × Ownership %) - Exercise Cost

DILUTION FROM FUTURE EQUITY GRANTS:

Model ongoing dilution from hiring:

Year    New Hires    Avg Grant     Total Options    Dilution    Cumulative Dilution
1       25           10,000        250,000          2.5%        2.5%
2       30           10,000        300,000          3.0%        5.4%
3       35           10,000        350,000          3.5%        8.7%


Shows how giving equity to employees dilutes all shareholders over time.

$100M         $45M        $25M        $20M        $10M
$200M         $95M        $45M        $40M        $20M
$500M         $240M       $110M       $100M       $50M


INTEGRATION:
Link cap table to financial model:
- Funding rounds flow into Cash Flow statement
- Fully diluted shares used for per-share metrics
- Option pool expenses flow to P&L (stock-based comp)
- Liquidation preferences affect exit scenario planning
