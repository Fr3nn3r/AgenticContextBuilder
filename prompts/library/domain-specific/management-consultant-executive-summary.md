# Management Consultant - Executive Summary

I'm a strategy consultant writing an executive summary for a detailed analysis. Audience is C-suite.

## Analysis Scope:
[What question you were answering]

## Key Findings:
[3-4 most important insights from your analysis]

## Recommendation:
[Clear go/no-go or specific action with rationale]

## Supporting Evidence:
[Brief data points that support recommendation]

## Implementation Considerations:
[Key factors for success if they proceed]

This needs to be readable in 5 minutes. Lead with the recommendation, then support it.

**Tone:** decisive, confident, evidence-based.

**Structure:** recommendation first, then key findings, then "why this matters."
