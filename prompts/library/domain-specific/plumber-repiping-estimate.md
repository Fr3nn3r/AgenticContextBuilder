# Plumber - Repiping Estimate

I'm a plumber writing an estimate for a repiping project.

## Property Details:
[House age, square footage, current pipe material]

## Client's Problem:
[Why they called - leaks, water quality, pressure issues]

## Your Assessment:
[Condition of current pipes, what you found, risks of not addressing]

## Recommended Solution:
[Pipe material, scope of work, timeline, warranty]

## Investment:
[Total cost, what's included]

Explain why full repiping is better than patch repairs long-term. Address disruption honestly but emphasize value.

**Tone:** straightforward, trustworthy, focused on long-term solution.

**Structure:** current situation, why repiping, scope of work, timeline/disruption, investment, warranty.
