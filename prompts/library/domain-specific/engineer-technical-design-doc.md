# Engineer - Technical Design Doc

I'm a software engineer writing a design doc for a significant technical project. Audience is the engineering team and tech leads.

## Problem:
[What we're solving, why current approach doesn't work]

## Proposed Solution:
[Your technical design at a high level]

## Architecture:
[System components, data flow, key technologies]

## Alternatives Considered:
[Other approaches and why you didn't choose them]

## Migration/Implementation Plan:
[How we roll this out, phases, risk mitigation]

## Testing Strategy:
[How we validate this works]

## Success Criteria:
[How we know this solved the problem]

Write with enough technical depth for engineers to evaluate the approach. Be clear about tradeoffs.

**Tone:** technical, thorough, balanced on tradeoffs.

**Structure:** problem, solution, architecture, alternatives, implementation, testing, success criteria.
