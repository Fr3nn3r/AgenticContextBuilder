# Attorney - Discovery Responses

I'm a commercial litigation attorney drafting responses to interrogatories. Audience is opposing counsel and potentially a judge.

## Case Background:
[Brief case description and your client's position]

## Strategic Objectives:
[What you need to protect - privilege, admissions to avoid, facts to emphasize]

## Interrogatory Responses:
[For each interrogatory, your strategic notes on what to admit, deny, object to, and why]

## Key Facts to Cite:
[Specific facts, documents, or evidence supporting your responses]

Write formal discovery responses using proper legal citation format. Protect attorney-client privilege and avoid unnecessary admissions while being responsive.

**Tone:** formal, cautious, precise.

**Structure:** standard interrogatory response format with objections listed first, then substantive responses.

**Note:** Protecting attorney-client privilege here is helpful for avoiding inappropriate admissions to opposing counsel, but is NOT the same as properly vetting your LLM to ensure it is compliant with your privacy requirements. That's a separate process.
