# Insurance Agent - Policy Comparison

I'm an insurance agent writing a policy comparison for a client.

## Client Situation:
[Property type, coverage needs, risk factors]

## Client Priorities:
[What matters most to them - coverage, price, deductible, claims service]

## Policy Options:
[For each option: carrier, premium, deductible, coverage highlights, exclusions]

## Meaningful Differences:
[What actually matters between these options for this client]

Explain the real differences without industry jargon. Help them make an informed decision.

**Tone:** educational, patient, unbiased.

**Format:** side-by-side comparison focused on what matters to this client.
