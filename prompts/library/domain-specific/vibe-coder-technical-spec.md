# Vibe Coder - Technical Spec

I'm a developer writing a technical spec for a feature or project. This is for the engineering team and needs to balance speed with clarity.

## Project/Feature:
[What you're building]

## The Vibe:
[The overall approach/philosophy - quick MVP, experimental, production-ready, etc.]

## Technical Approach:
[Stack, key libraries, architecture decisions, why this approach]

## What We're NOT Doing:
[Scope boundaries, what's out of scope for now]

## Key Decisions & Tradeoffs:
[Important choices you made and why, what you're optimizing for]

## Open Questions:
[What you're still figuring out or need input on]

Write this conversationally but with enough technical detail that someone can implement it. Focus on the "why" behind decisions.

**Tone:** casual but technical, pragmatic, collaborative.

**Structure:** context, approach, key decisions, open questions, next steps.
