# Electrician - Panel Upgrade Proposal

I'm an electrician writing a proposal for an electrical panel upgrade.

## Current Situation:
[Current panel amperage, age, condition]

## Why Upgrade Is Needed:
[New loads being added - EV charger, heat pump, etc., or code/safety issues]

## Safety Concerns:
[Any code violations or hazards you identified]

## Recommended Solution:
[New panel specs, scope of work, permits needed]

## Timeline and Investment:
[How long, how much, what's included]

Explain why this upgrade is necessary for safety and future capacity. Be safety-focused without fearmongering.

**Tone:** informative, safety-conscious, practical.

**Structure:** current state, why upgrade needed, solution, permits/timeline, investment.
