# CPA - Tax Strategy Letter

I'm a CPA writing a year-end tax planning letter to a business client.

## Client Business Type:
[Entity type, industry, revenue range]

## Current Tax Situation:
[Key numbers, tax position, changes from last year]

## Opportunities Identified:
[Specific strategies you're recommending and why]

## Action Items:
[What they need to do and by when]

Write this in accessible language without dumbing it down. Help them understand why these strategies matter.

**Tone:** advisory, confident, action-oriented.

**Structure:** situation summary, recommendations with rationale, action items with deadlines.
