# HVAC Contractor - Estimate

I'm an HVAC contractor writing a professional estimate for a homeowner. I just completed a site inspection.

## Property Details:
[Square footage, type, year built]

## Client's Main Concern:
[Their pain point - comfort issues, high bills, etc.]

## Inspection Findings:
[Current system specs, age, ductwork condition, sizing issues, code problems]

## Your Recommended Solution:
[Equipment specs, repairs, timeline, investment, expected outcomes]

## Competing Quote Context:
[Other quotes they mentioned, if any]

Write a professional estimate in accessible language. Explain why proper sizing and addressing root causes matters. Educate without disparaging competitors.

**Tone:** educational, reassuring, confident. Emphasize comfort and savings over specs. No jargon.

**Structure:** problem summary, solution, why this approach, investment/timeline, next steps.
