# Product Manager - PRD (Product Requirements Document)

I'm a product manager writing a PRD for a new feature or product. Audience is engineering, design, and leadership.

## Problem Statement:
[What user problem are we solving, why does it matter]

## Success Metrics:
[How we'll measure if this worked]

## User Stories:
[Key use cases and user flows]

## Requirements:
[Must-haves, should-haves, nice-to-haves]

## Technical Considerations:
[Known constraints, dependencies, integrations]

## Open Questions:
[What we still need to figure out]

## Timeline & Scope:
[Launch target, phasing if applicable]

Write this to align the team around the "why" and "what" while leaving room for engineering to solve the "how."

**Tone:** clear, user-focused, collaborative.

**Structure:** problem, success metrics, requirements, considerations, timeline.
