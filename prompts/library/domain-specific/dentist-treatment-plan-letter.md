# Dentist - Treatment Plan Letter

I'm a dentist writing a treatment plan letter to a patient.

## Patient Situation:
[Current oral health status]

## Issues Identified:
[Cavities, gum disease, other problems and their severity]

## Recommended Treatment Sequence:
[What needs to happen, in what order, and why]

## What Happens If Untreated:
[Consequences of delaying care]

## Investment and Options:
[Cost, insurance coverage, payment plans if applicable]

Explain the sequence and why each step matters. Address cost concerns by explaining outcomes.

**Tone:** caring, educational, not judgmental.

**Structure:** current situation, recommended treatment with rationale, timeline, investment, next steps.
