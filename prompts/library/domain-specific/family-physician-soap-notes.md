# Family Physician - SOAP Notes

I'm a family physician documenting a patient visit. This needs SOAP note format for insurance purposes.

## Patient Information:
[Age, gender, relevant medical history]

## Chief Complaint:
[Why they came in today]

## Subjective Notes:
[Patient's description of symptoms, timeline, what makes it better/worse]

## Objective Findings:
[Vitals, exam findings, test results]

## Assessment:
[Your diagnosis or differential]

## Plan:
[Treatment, prescriptions, follow-up, patient education provided]

Make this complete and insurance-friendly while staying clinically accurate. Include relevant ICD-10 codes.

**Tone:** clinical, precise, thorough.

**Structure:** standard SOAP format.
