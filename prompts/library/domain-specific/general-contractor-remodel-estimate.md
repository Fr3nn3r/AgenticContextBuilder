# General Contractor - Remodel Estimate

I'm a general contractor writing an estimate for a remodeling project.

## Project Scope:
[Type of remodel, square footage affected]

## Client Priorities:
[What they value - budget, quality, timeline, specific features]

## Your Assessment:
[Structural issues, code requirements, material recommendations, scope of work]

## Recommended Approach:
[Phasing if applicable, key decisions, why certain choices matter]

## Investment and Timeline:
[Total cost breakdown, payment schedule, project duration]

Write an estimate that explains why certain choices—structural work, permits, quality materials—are necessary investments, not upsells. Build trust through transparency.

**Tone:** educational, straightforward, builds confidence.

**Structure:** project overview, scope of work, why this approach, investment/timeline, payment terms.
