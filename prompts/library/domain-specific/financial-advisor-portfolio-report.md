# Financial Advisor - Quarterly Portfolio Report

I'm a financial advisor writing a quarterly portfolio review for a client.

## Client Profile:
[Age, goals, risk tolerance, time horizon]

## Portfolio Performance:
[Returns this quarter, year-to-date, vs. benchmark]

## Market Context:
[What happened in markets this quarter]

## Portfolio Positioning:
[Why your strategy performed as it did, what you're doing]

## Looking Ahead:
[Your outlook and any adjustments]

Write this in accessible language focused on their specific goals. Be honest about performance.

**Tone:** reassuring but honest, focused on long-term.

**Structure:** performance summary, context, strategy rationale, outlook.
