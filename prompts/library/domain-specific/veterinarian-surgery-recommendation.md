# Veterinarian - Surgery Recommendation

I'm a veterinarian writing a surgery recommendation letter for a pet owner.

## Pet Information:
[Species, breed, age, relevant history]

## Diagnosis:
[What's wrong, how you diagnosed it]

## Recommended Treatment:
[Surgery type, why you recommend it over alternatives]

## Recovery Timeline:
[What to expect post-surgery, restrictions, follow-up]

## Prognosis:
[Expected outcome with vs. without surgery]

## Investment:
[Cost range, what's included]

Explain this honestly including risks. Address cost concerns by explaining long-term outcomes.

**Tone:** compassionate, thorough, realistic.

**Structure:** diagnosis, recommendation with rationale, recovery, prognosis, alternatives, investment.
