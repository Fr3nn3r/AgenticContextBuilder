# College Counselor - Student Recommendation Letter

I'm a high school counselor writing a college recommendation letter.

## Student Information:
[Name, applying to which programs/schools]

## Key Strengths:
[Academic abilities, personal qualities, what makes them stand out]

## Specific Examples:
[Concrete moments, achievements, or projects that demonstrate these strengths]

## Growth or Challenges:
[How they've grown or overcome obstacles, if relevant]

## Why They'll Succeed:
[What makes you confident they'll thrive in college/this program]

Write 400-500 words. Be enthusiastic but credible - highlight genuine strengths with specific evidence.

**Tone:** supportive, specific, credible.

**Structure:** introduction of student, key strengths with examples, growth/context, strong closing endorsement.
