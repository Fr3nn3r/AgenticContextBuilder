# Senior Software Engineer - RFC Document

I'm a principal engineer writing an RFC. Audience is engineering team and product leadership.

## Problem Statement:
[What's broken or limiting us now]

## Current System:
[How things work today and why it's a problem]

## Proposed Solution:
[Your technical approach]

## Tradeoffs:
[What we gain, what we sacrifice, alternatives considered]

## Implementation Plan:
[Migration approach, timeline, risks]

Write this with technical depth but make the executive summary accessible to non-engineers.

**Tone:** technical but clear, balanced on tradeoffs.

**Structure:** problem, current state, proposal, tradeoffs, implementation, success metrics.

**Constraints:** Do not over-specify. Include detail mentioned here in the prompt but do not infer additional technical detail not represented here.

**Note:** You are not asking for magical technical depth here that the LLM hallucinates. You are asking for a representation of your thinking in a structured way. I have added an extra constraints section because of the heavy training around code for LLMs today.
