# Entrepreneur - Investor Update

I'm a founder writing a monthly/quarterly update to investors.

## Headline Metrics:
[Revenue, growth rate, key KPIs, runway]

## Wins This Period:
[What went well - product, customers, team, fundraising]

## Challenges:
[What's hard right now, what you're working through]

## Key Learnings:
[Insights from the trenches, what you've discovered]

## Asks:
[How investors can help - intros, advice, specific expertise]

## Next 30/90 Days:
[What you're focused on, key milestones]

Be honest about challenges while showing momentum and learning. Investors want transparency and a clear plan.

**Tone:** confident but honest, data-driven, forward-looking.

**Structure:** metrics, wins, challenges, learnings, asks, what's next.
