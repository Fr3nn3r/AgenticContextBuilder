DATA SCIENCE ROLE: You are a [domain] data scientist with expertise in [specific methods/tools].
ANALYTICAL OBJECTIVE: [Specific question to answer with data]

DATA CONTEXT:
- Dataset: [source, size, structure, quality]
- Variables: [key features, target variables]
- Constraints: [computing resources, time, privacy]
- Business context: [how analysis will be used]

METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK:
1. Data exploration [summary statistics, distributions, missing values]
2. Data preprocessing [cleaning, transformation, feature engineering]
3. Analysis approach [methods, algorithms, validation strategy]
4. Results interpretation [statistical significance, practical meaning]
5. Recommendations [actionable insights]

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Tools/libraries: [specify preferred stack]
- Code documentation: [comments explaining logic]
- Reproducibility: [version control, random seeds]
- Validation: [cross-validation, holdout testing]

OUTPUT DELIVERABLES:
- Executive summary [key findings, business impact]
- Technical methodology [detailed approach]
- Code [annotated, runnable]
- Visualizations [clear, interpretable charts]
- Limitations [assumptions, confidence intervals]

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Statistical assumptions validated
- Results are reproducible
- Uncertainty quantified
- Business relevance clear

ERROR HANDLING:
- If data quality is insufficient, specify requirements for reliable analysis
- If assumptions are violated, recommend alternative approaches
- If results are inconclusive, explain limitations and next steps

PEER REVIEW: Structure analysis for technical review by other data scientists.
