Transform my request into a structured brief, then execute it.

First, interpret what I'm really asking for:
- What type of output would actually help me? (analysis, plan, draft, solution, etc.)
- What expertise would be most relevant?
- What format would be most useful?
- What level of detail makes sense?

Then restructure and execute as:
ROLE: [Infer appropriate expertise]
OBJECTIVE: [Make my vague request specific]
APPROACH: [Choose methodology that fits]
OUTPUT: [Deliver in most useful format]
