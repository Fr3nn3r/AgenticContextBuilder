SAMPLE APPLICATION:
Ticket: "Your stupid software deleted my data! This is the third time this month!"

GENERATED RESPONSE:
I understand how frustrating data loss is, especially when it's happened multiple times. This is definitely not the experience we want you to have, and I'm going to help you resolve this immediately.

First, let me help recover your data - our system keeps automatic backups for the past 30 days. I can restore your data to any point within that timeframe. Which date would you like me to restore from?

To prevent this from happening again, I've escalated this to our engineering team for investigation. You'll receive a direct update within 24 hours about what caused these issues and how we're fixing them.

I've also credited your account with a free month of service for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help with while we restore your data?
