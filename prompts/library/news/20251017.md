**Context:** You’ve just read a strategic AI news roundup covering major developments from October 13-17, 2025. Below is a summary of each story to ground our conversation:

**STORY 1: Anthropic Claude Skills (Oct 15)**
Anthropic released Claude Skills—a new architecture that packages instructions, scripts, and resources into reusable folders that Claude loads on-demand when relevant. Skills work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. The system makes Claude “faster, cheaper, and more consistent” by loading only minimal information when needed rather than repeatedly processing full context. Companies like Box, Canva, Rakuten, and Notion are early adopters. Anthropic provides Skills for Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and fillable PDFs. Tech observers like Simon Willison argue Skills may be “a bigger deal than MCP” because they’re conceptually simpler, require no server infrastructure, and work immediately across all Claude surfaces. Skills automatically stack together—Claude identifies which combinations are needed without manual orchestration.

**STORY 2: Google’s Cancer AI Breakthroughs (Oct 14-15)**
Google Research and DeepMind released two cancer AI models: (1) DeepSomatic—an AI tool using CNNs that identifies cancer-causing genetic mutations more accurately than existing methods, achieving 90% F1-score on insertions/deletions vs. 80% for next-best methods, with 10× speed improvement; (2) Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B—a 27-billion-parameter foundation model that generated a novel, experimentally validated hypothesis about cancer immunotherapy. The AI analyzed 4,000+ drugs and predicted that silmitasertib (CX-4945) would dramatically boost immune visibility of “cold tumors” when combined with low-dose interferon. Lab tests confirmed ~50% increase in antigen presentation. This marks the first peer-reviewable case of an LLM generating a novel cancer therapy hypothesis later validated in wet-lab experiments. Both models and datasets released open-source via GitHub.

**STORY 3: OpenAI-Broadcom 10-Gigawatt Chip Partnership (Oct 13)**
OpenAI and Broadcom announced a multi-year collaboration to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators (estimated $350-500B buildout). OpenAI designs the accelerators and rack systems; Broadcom develops and manufactures using Ethernet and connectivity solutions. Deployments begin second half 2026, completing by end of 2029. The 10 GW equals power consumption of ~8 million U.S. households or 5× Hoover Dam output. This adds to OpenAI’s existing commitments (~10 GW Nvidia, ~6 GW AMD, plus Oracle cloud), totaling roughly 26 GW across suppliers. The deal uses Broadcom Ethernet-based networking rather than Nvidia’s NVLink, suggesting a bet on vendor-neutral, scalable datacenter architectures. 2026-2029 timeline indicates planning for post-GPT-5 model generations.

**STORY 4: Perplexity Shopping (Oct 13)**
Perplexity launched Shopping—an AI-powered product search that generates visual answer cards with product recommendations, one-click checkout via Stripe, and free shipping for Pro subscribers. The feature combines web search, merchant partnerships, and affiliate revenue (from partners like Amazon, Shopify merchants). Users ask natural language queries; Perplexity returns curated product recommendations with research cards explaining why products match their needs. This represents Perplexity’s monetization pivot from pure search to transaction-enabled commerce. The system unbiased product recommendations with detailed research backing each suggestion.

**STORY 5: Microsoft Copilot Actions (Oct 13)**
Microsoft released Copilot Actions—automated workflows triggered by natural language that run on schedules across Microsoft 365. Users describe tasks in plain English (e.g., “summarize Teams messages every morning at 8am”); Copilot translates them into automations. Examples: daily meeting prep summaries, weekly action item compilations, automated follow-ups. The feature ships with 10 pre-built templates and integrates with Power Automate for advanced users. This represents Microsoft’s push toward proactive AI agents rather than reactive chat assistants. Windows 11 also gets voice-activated Copilot that can control settings, launch apps, and manage files hands-free.

**STORY 6: Nvidia DGX Spark (Oct 15)**
Nvidia shipped DGX Spark—a $3,999 desktop computer with 144 Arm Grace CPU cores, 64GB LPDDR5X memory, and support for 16TB storage. The GB10 Grace Blackwell system brings datacenter-class AI development to individual researchers. DGX Spark runs inference and fine-tuning for models up to ~13B parameters locally, with claimed 100 tokens/second generation speed for 7B models. Targets developers working on multi-agent systems, robotics simulation, and edge AI deployment who need realistic testing environments before cloud-scale deployment. Named Time Magazine Best Inventions 2025 for accessibility impact.

**STORY 7: Andrej Karpathy’s nanoChat (Oct 14)**
Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy released nanoChat—a minimal end-to-end ChatGPT-style pipeline anyone can train from scratch for ~$100 in compute costs in about 4 hours. The project pre-trains a 561M parameter language model, applies supervised fine-tuning, implements RLHF with reward modeling and PPO, and deploys a functional chatbot. Full code, training scripts, and model weights released via Hugging Face under permissive license. Trained on single Nvidia H100 GPU using Modal cloud platform. Explicitly targets students, hobbyists, and researchers who want to understand LLM training mechanics without abstractions. The 561M model performs poorly compared to production systems, giving users realistic intuition about why frontier models require billions in compute.

**FAVORITE READ: “Just Talk To It” by Peter Steinberger**
Field report from an engineer building a 300k+ LOC TypeScript project entirely with AI agents. Steinberger runs 3-8 parallel instances of OpenAI’s codex CLI in a terminal grid, lets agents make atomic git commits, and spends 20% of time on AI-driven refactoring. He’s moved away from Claude Code due to language/UX friction, dismisses most agentic tooling as “thin wrappers with no moat,” and argues the industry overcomplicates workflows with subagents and elaborate prompt engineering when simple conversational iteration works better. Uses GPT-5-codex for its 230k usable context, efficient token use, and superior file-reading strategy. His Agents.md file is 800 lines of “organizational scar tissue” auto-generated by the model. Screenshots constitute ~50% of his prompts for faster context-sharing. Key insight: Intuition beats infrastructure—the best way to work with AI agents isn’t building elaborate scaffolding, it’s developing judgment about scope, knowing when to intervene, and treating AI like a collaborator you’re iterating with in real-time.
