# Prompt 1: Process-Focused Portfolio Piece Generator

You are an expert technical writer helping me create a portfolio piece that demonstrates process thinking and problem-solving capability, not just polished outcomes.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
[Describe your project here - include: what you built, pivots, setbacks, challenges, tradeoffs, your PROCESS, the tech stack, the timeline, and the end result]

PORTFOLIO OBJECTIVE:
Create a 1,500-2,000 word portfolio narrative that makes my problem-solving process verifiable and demonstrates how I actually work, including mistakes and iteration.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
Create a markdown document with these exact sections:

1. **The Problem & Constraints (200-300 words)**
   - What was the actual problem I was solving (not just "build X")?
   - What constraints was I working under (time, technical, knowledge gaps)?
   - What did I NOT know at the start?
   
2. **Initial Approach & First Failure (300-400 words)**
   - What did I try first and why?
   - Where did that approach break down?
   - What did that failure teach me?

3. **Iteration Cycles (400-600 words)**
   For each major pivot (2-3 cycles maximum):
   - What did I change and why?
   - What new information drove this decision?
   - Include specific decision points with rationale
   - Show where I got stuck and how I debugged it

4. **LLM Usage (if applicable) (200-300 words)**
   - Include 1-2 actual prompts I used (in code blocks)
   - Show where I overrode LLM suggestions and why
   - Demonstrate my iteration pattern with the LLM
   - What did I learn about using LLMs effectively on this project?

5. **Retrospective: What I'd Do Differently (200-300 words)**
   - 3-5 specific changes I'd make
   - Why each change would matter
   - What I learned that I didn't know at the start

WRITING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use first person ("I tried X because...")
- Include specific technical details (file names, error messages, metrics)
- Be honest about mistakes - make them interesting, not embarrassing
- Write like you're explaining to a peer, not a resume reviewer
- Avoid phrases like "successfully implemented" or "effectively solved"
- Include at least one "I was completely stuck for X hours until..." moment

FORMATTING:
- Use code blocks for: prompts, error messages, key code snippets
- Use bold for key decision points
- Keep paragraphs under 4 sentences
- Include at least one diagram/visual if relevant (describe it if you can't create it)

VERIFICATION ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
- Commit history or timeline markers ("Day 3: Realized X wouldn't work")
- Specific metrics showing before/after of decisions
- Links to actual artifacts if they exist (GitHub commits, docs, etc.)

TONE: 
Write like a technical blog post, not a resume. Think Julia Evans or Dan Luu - clear, honest, teaching-focused. Show that you can reflect on your work critically and learn from experience.

Now write this portfolio piece based on my project description above.
